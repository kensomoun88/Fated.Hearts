First Prince.

4
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,510
Since His Majesty no longer
holds him accountable,

5
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,950
then please leave the punishment

6
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,280
of General Xun to me.

7
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,840
Sure.

8
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,329
First Prince!

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,490
You've gone too far!

Princess Xiyang's wedding is
just around the corner.

11
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,240
I hope you'll keep the bigger picture
in mind

12
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,700
and not break royal protocol,
First Prince.

13
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,750
You want dignity?

14
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,400
Then listen carefully.

15
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,430
From now on, if anyone dares

16
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,760
to harm Fu Yixiao again,

17
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,280

Guess who I am?

23
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,820
Why did you do that?

24
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,950
Are you in a bad mood?

25
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,710

00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,400
had the nerve to offend our First Prince?

28

Weren't you supposed to be at the border

30
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,610
Why are you suddenly back?

31
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,030
Well, it's Princess Xiyang's wedding soon,
isn't it?

32
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,710
Can't our Murong family

33
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,310
at least send someone back

34
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,560
to attend the ceremony?

35
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,220
I was going to come back alone,

36
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,500
but my father insisted on coming with me.

37
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,430
The Elder Marquis is back in Yujing too?

38
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,030
Yes.

39
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,560
Since you're in a bad mood,

40
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,020
how about I go with you for
a couple of drinks?

41
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,079
Please let the Elder Marquis know

42
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,680
that I'll definitely pay him a visit

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,340
in person when I have the time.

44
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,030
You really aren't coming drinking with me?

45
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,240
I'll go by myself then.

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,770
Go ahead.

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,710
I'm really going, you know?

48
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,340

What exactly happened

52
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,370
in the court today?

53
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,090
His Highness acted rashly today.

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,840
Why was His Highness

55
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,520
removed from the position
of secondary officiant?

56
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,870
Today, His Highness mentioned
the late Empress's death

57
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,430
in front of His Majesty.

58
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,120
But...

59
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,240
Doesn't His Majesty forbid anyone
from mentioning...

60
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,680
Since you know it's forbidden,
why bring it up?

61
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,080
Weren't you the one
who brought it up first?

62
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,270
I know.

63
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,870
All these years,

64
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
when has His Highness ever

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,240
mentioned this in front of His Majesty?

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,000
And it's precisely because of this

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,830
that the father and son
were able to preserve

68
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,430
the last shred of their bond.

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,409
But today,

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,890
His Majesty clearly knew Empress Zhuang

71
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,800
wanted to harm Miss Yixiao,

72
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,200
yet he turned a blind eye.

73
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,950
What else could His Highness have done?

74
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,390
His Highness must have thought of

75
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,790
the late Empress's death,

76
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,920
so in a moment of panic,

77
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,520
he spoke without restraint.

78
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,950
Even so,

79
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,040
they shouldn't let the Second Prince

80
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,190
take His Highness's place.

81
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,120
Princess Xiyang

82
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,430
is His Highness's biological sister,

83
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,920
and His Highness

84
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,270
is His Majesty's eldest son.

85
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,720
By every measure—emotionally, logically,
publicly, and privately—

86
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,320
this matter shouldn't have ended up
like this.

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,830
From now on, you may say

88
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,290
such things in front of me,

89
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,820
but keep your mouth shut out there.

90
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,420
You think His Highness doesn't
have enough on his plate already?

91
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,920
His Highness fought for Susha

92
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,980
on bloody battlefields.

93
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,630
But in the end,

94
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,190
who appreciates what he's done?

95
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,800
I shouldn't have let him go
in the first place.

96
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,260
Shouldn't have let him go?

97
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,720
Would he have listened to you?

98
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,510
Once His Highness makes a decision,

99
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,480
who can stop him?

100
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,270
Back then, it was people from Jinxiu

101
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,310
who kept trying to assassinate
Miss Yixiao.

102
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,950
But now,

103
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,160
someone from our Susha Kingdom
wants to kill her,

104
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,390
right under His Highness's nose.

105
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,920
How could he not intervene?

106
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,800
Others may not understand

107
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,000
why His Highness did that,

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,190
but both of us know clearly

109
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:34,920
that he did it just to

110
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,870
send a message to Prime Minister Zhuang,
Empress Zhuang,

111
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,130
and everyone else that

112
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,800
from now on,
anyone who dares lay a hand on Miss Yixiao

113
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
will meet the same fate as Xun Xiang.

114
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,190
I really don't know
whether you're truly clever

115
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,590
or just pretending to be.

116
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,040
It seems the First Prince

117
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,560
has completely enraged His Majesty
this time.

118
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,000
Do you think His Majesty's actions

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,800
indicate he intends to appoint Chengyang

120
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
as the Crown Prince?

121
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,160
His Majesty's mind is hard to read.

122
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,290
It's still too early

123
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,710
to speculate about that.

124
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:04,810
However,

125
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,000
I've already sent people
to spread this matter

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,600
widely outside the palace.

127
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,680
By now, throughout Yujing City,

128
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,000
I believe everyone has known that
the First Prince

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,660
has lost the Emperor's favor.

130
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,040
In that case,

131
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,510
the situation becomes

132
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,970
even more favorable to us.

133
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,100
That Feng Suige

134
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,630
is still too young and naive,

135
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,290
thinking he can challenge us.

136
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,690
How many times have I told you

137
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,600
that Feng Suige

138
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,440
is not as simple as you imagine.

139
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,360
You mustn't let your guard down.

140
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,920
As for the matter of the ritual,

141
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,180
it seems to me that he doesn't care
at all.

142
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,310
Father, why do you always
build up others' presence

143
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,920
at the cost of our own authority?

144
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,750
In my opinion,

145
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,310
he simply can't let go of

146
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,370
the grievances his mother suffered,

147
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,409
thus he keeps looking for ways
to pick fights with us.

148
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,270
Mother!

149
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,880
Greetings, Mother.

150
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,390
Greetings, Grandfather.

151
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,320
Why are you running in such a hurry?

152
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,210
Look at you, sweating all over.

153
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,920
Be careful not to catch a cold.

154
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,630
Mother,

155
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
why has Father suddenly assigned me

156
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,070
to serve as the secondary officiant
at the Ancestral Ceremony?

157
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,200
What about Brother?

158
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,120
Anything happened to him?

159
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,520
Why do you care about him?

160
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,930
Just remember this:

161
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,270
listen to your father

162
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,680
and don't go against him.

163
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,480
There will be plenty of benefits
for you in the future.

164
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,190
Don't follow your brother's example.

165
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,160
I don't know what Brother

166
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,530
has done wrong,

167
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,000
but he's definitely not
that kind of person.

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,390
You may see him as your brother,

169
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,520
but he might not treat you the same way.

170
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,760
Don't overthink it.

171
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,560
Your father must have his reasons

172
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,290
for making such arrangements.

173
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,890
Just listen to your mother.

174
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,450
Don't defy His Majesty

175
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,230
or make him angry.

176
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,870
But according to ancestral tradition,

177
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,630
the role of secondary officiant
at the Ancestral Ceremony

178
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,490
should be performed by Brother.

179
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,090
If I take Brother's place,

180
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,850
then how will

181
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,870
the court officials

182
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,870
and the citizens of Yujing City

183
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,130
view him in the future?

184
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,680
And how will Brother be able to

185
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,920
hold his head up in Yujing City
after that?

186
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,000

200
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,370
Mother was wronged.

201

She wasn't a spy of Jinxiu.

worry about this matter anymore.

216

of your father?

219
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,130
He's only asking you to call me "Mother."

220
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,100
Why are you so unwilling to say it?

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,870

to defy him like this.

229
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,600

You were paying respects to your mother.

I didn't want to disturb you,

237
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,370

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,200
Is the clue you were talking about here?

316
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,200
Of course not.

317
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,350
So you deliberately tricked me into
coming here?

318
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,480
There's a Zi'an Lake in Pingling City.

319
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,200
In the past, when I was in a bad mood

320
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,680
or had troubles,

321
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,550
besides practicing archery,

322
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,750
I would find a boat

323
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,960
and lie down in it,

324
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,830
letting it drift on the water,

325
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,290
floating away.

326
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,440
As it drifted,

327
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,650
all my troubles would drift away too.

328
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,480

329
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,010

on and off.

So your father

334
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,270
really had someone

335
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,880
take your place at the Ancestral Ceremony?

336
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,540
I don't care about any of that.

337
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,400
What you actually care more about is

338
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,600
your mother's death,

339
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,920
right?

340
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,110
How did your mother pass away?

341
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,550
If you don't want to talk about it,

342
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,550
you don't have to.

343
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,440
15 years ago,

344
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,830
Zhuang Shen and his daughter

345
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,630
captured several Jinxiu spies.

346
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,160
Those people actually confessed

347
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
that my mother was also a Jinxiu spy.

348
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,240
Then her personal maid

349
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,550
also came forward to testify against her,

350
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,270
claiming that my mother

351
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,310
had secretly met with people from Jinxiu.

352
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,110
All evidence pointed to her.

353
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,210
Is this Her Majesty's letter?

354
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,370
Yes,

355
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
this is indeed Her Majesty's

356
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,460
letter of treason.

357
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,060
Later, my mother passed away.

358
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,550
Those Jinxiu spies

359
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,250
committed suicide in prison,

360
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,350
and her personal maid

361
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,350
also died of illness shortly after.

362
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,560
It was all Zhuang Shen
and Empress Zhuang's doing, right?

363
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,820
They were very careful

364
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,830
and destroyed all the evidence.

365
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
But I know it must have been them.

366
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,340
If you say so, then it must be true.

367
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,030
Although my hand injury

368
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,480
hasn't completely healed yet,

369
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,030
within 50 paces,

370
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,920
I can still shoot with perfect accuracy.

371
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,850
If you need me to,

372
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,440
I can take the lives of Zhuang Shen

373
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,840

558
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,270
If you encounter any

559
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,380
unpleasant things in the future,

560
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,870
♪ I suddenly realized what it means
to be unmatched ♪

561
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,550
don't hide alone

562
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,120
in that dark ancestral hall anymore.

563
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,370
♪ What it means to long,
what it means to burn ♪

564
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,070
Do you hear me?

565
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,070
I understand.

566
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,300
♪ The scars left along the way ♪

567
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,750
♪ In an instant, because of you ♪

568
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,430
♪ With a smile, they ascend like feathers,
spreading in all directions ♪

569
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,550
I haven't had any more nightmares

570
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,680
these past few days.

571
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,110
There's no need to
put out these flowers anymore.

572
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,440
I'm just placing some bouquets

573
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,370
to freshen up the room, that's all.

574
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,830
If you have spare money for flowers,

575
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,270
you might as well save it

576
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,400
to improve the food in your residence.

577
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,510
Plain soup and simple dishes every day

578
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,510
doesn't seem fitting for a First Prince.

579
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,000
The military funds are tight,

580
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
so I have to deduct from my own share.

581
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,810
What do you want to eat?

582
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,880
I'll have the kitchen make it for you.

583
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,790
Don't bother.

584
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,350
I'm not that delicate.

585
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,210
Your Highness.

586
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,300
Your Highness.

587
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,130
News just came from the palace:

588
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,790
today, the Second Prince spoke up

589
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,680
for Your Highness in court

590
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,200
and nearly angered His Majesty.

591
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,110
It was only after the senior officials
persuaded him

592
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,400
that he finally accepted the position of
secondary officiant.

593
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,000
When Chengyang learns about

594
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,310
the grudges between me,

595
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,170
his mother, and his grandfather,

596
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,830
what will he think?

597
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,400
Don't overthink it.

598
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,720
Nothing can be perfect.

599
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
As long as your conscience is clear.

600
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,560
By the way,

601
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,070
I suddenly remembered some clues

602
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,270
about Meng Junran.

603
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,480
Before falling off the cliff,

604
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
I heard him say

605
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,270
he delivered a batch of silver

606
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,610
to Xia Jingshi.

607
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,920
When will the military funds

608
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,450
you promised be delivered?

609
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,400
Yesterday, 100,000 taels of silver

610
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,480
were already entrusted to

611
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,590
the Rongtong Escort Agency for transport.

612
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,090
The agency responsible for
escorting that batch of silver

613
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,690
was the Rongtong Escort Agency
of Yujing City.

614
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,160
I know this escort agency.

615
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,320
They'll take on any escort job,
no matter how risky,

616
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,790
and they're quite well-known
in Yujing City.

617
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,650
Go investigate

618
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,240
and find out who sent goods to Xia Jingshi

619
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,640
through the Rongtong Escort Agency.

620
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,240
Yes.

621
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,880
[Jingming Garden]

622
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,840
Your Highness.

623
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,440
Feng Suige will

624
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,480
attend the Ancestral Ceremony tomorrow.

625
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,400
I will take this opportunity

626
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,530
to meet with Wu Ying.

627
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,660
Find a way to notify Wu Ying,

628
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,500
but make sure no one finds out.

629
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,550
Yes.

630
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,070
Your Highness, please take a look at this.

631
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,030
I calculated the time

632
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,110
and made some inquiries.

633
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,240
Before Miss Yixiao fell off the cliff,

634
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,200
someone did contact
the Rongtong Escort Agency

635
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,590
to escort a batch of goods

636
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,120
to Pingling City in Jinxiu.

637
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,550
It was this woman.

638
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,160
Based on the owner's description,

639
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,880
I had someone draw this portrait.

640
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,960
It's just that since it's been too long,

641
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,310
the owner only remembers vaguely.

642
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,440
It's said this woman

643
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,890
seemed quite generous,

644
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,110
but she wouldn't let anyone
inquire about her identity.

645
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,240
She said that after arriving in
Pingling City,

646
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,100
someone would surely be there
to receive the goods.

647
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,720
This woman must have

648
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,830
some connection with that Meng Junran.

649
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,830
Send more people.

650
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,110
Anyone who bears

651
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,680
even the slightest resemblance
to this portrait—

652
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,160
investigate them all thoroughly.

653
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,100
Yes.

654
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,780
Your Highness,

655
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,330
Junior Marquis is here.

656
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,240
Why is he here?

657
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,310
Why can't I be here?

658
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,330
I didn't want to come,

659
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,160
but I heard from my father

660
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,090
that you got in some bad luck,
so I came to check on you.

661
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,290
I didn't know

662
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,400
that your father

663
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,830
could order you around.

664
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,840
If you missed me, just say so.

665
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,260
Don't use your father as an excuse.

666
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,590
I planned to drink with you last night,

667
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,510
but just before leaving,

668
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,310
I suddenly learned that His Majesty

669
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,790
wants me to be some
Imperial Guards' Commander-in-Chief.

670
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,770
So I decided I didn't want to see

671
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,100
any of you court people.

672
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,270
It even made me

673
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,530
lose sleep last night.

674
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,830
Isn't that as good as His Majesty
sentencing me to death?

675
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,920
Why did His Majesty suddenly ask you

676
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,070
to be the Commander-in-Chief
of the Imperial Guards?

677
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,970
Who knows?

678
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,330
He said it's to train me.

679
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,880
But you know your father.

680
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,330
What he says and what he thinks

681
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,390
are never the same.

682
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,790
Rather than being an official,

683
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,180
I prefer spending time with the beauties
in my mansion,

684
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,550
traveling and enjoying life.

685
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,680
I was thinking of running away

686
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,440
before the imperial edict

687
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,920
was officially issued,

688
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,220
but then I thought,

689
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,920
if I became the Commander-in-Chief
of the Imperial Guards,

690
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,580
I'd surely be able to help you.

691
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,590
Don't you do that for me.

692
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,530
I know

693
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,030
you hate being tied down the most.

694
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,890
Don't say that.

695
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,110
You already have

696
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,640
little influence at court.

697
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,480
Now that His Majesty has even had
the Second Prince

698
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,530
take your place at the Ancestral Ceremony,

699
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,590
how could I leave you behind

700
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,990
and enjoy freedom alone?

701
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,920
So lovey-dovey.

702
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,090
Why don't you two just go get married?

703
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
You're jealous, right?

704
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,480
You're definitely jealous.

705
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,960
The beauty in this portrait is...

706
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,620
Is it her that you painted?

707
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,000
Me? Paint her?

708
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
No need to hide it.

709
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,400
The one you painted is me.

710
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,620
What's the problem with that?

711
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,110
Right.

712
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,650
I did paint you.

713
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,480
How is it?

714
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,960
Do you like it?

715
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,740
Of course I like it.

716
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,680
My husband painted it for me himself.

717
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,880
I absolutely love it.

718
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,230
I've had enough.

719
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,580
I need to go wash my eyes.

720
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,580
I'm leaving. No need to see me out.

721
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,880
In Yujing City,

722
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,510
whether from noble families

723
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,910
or entertainment boats,

724
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,730
he knows most

725
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,810
of the women there.

726
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,880
With his help,

727
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,750
our investigation will be much easier.

728
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,510
Why didn't you

729
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,670
let me tell him just now?

730
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,760
I just feel

731
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,380
the fewer people who know about this,
the better.

732
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,110
I have no hostility toward him.

733
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,440
It's just that every time I see him,

734
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,710
I feel uncomfortable.

735
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,400
I can't explain why.

736
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,100
Could it be that you're really...

737
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,450
Jealous of him?

738
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,310
Alright.

739
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,770
Come on.

740
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,260
From now on, these secrets

741
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,050
will be kept between us.

742
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,550
I won't tell anyone else.

743
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,280
Is that okay?

744
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,830
You and Junior Marquis

745
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,110
seem very close.

746
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,920
I've never seen you
treat anyone like that.

747
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,830
Why are you two

748
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,790
so close?

749
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,800
We experienced life and death together.

750
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,510
When we were little, the two of us

751
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,920
went with the Elder Marquis
to inspect the border,

752
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,030
and we were suddenly attacked
by assassins.

753
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,160
It was thanks to him
and the Elder Marquis

754
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,480
that I survived.

755
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,130
No wonder you trust him so much.

756
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,550
This guy

757
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,920
should be considered

758
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,790
my best friend.

759
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,480
Between us,

760
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,000
we could even

761
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,800
give up our lives for each other.

762
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,700
[Jingming Garden]

763
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,720
Not bad.

764
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,580
Today

765
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,110
is my first day in office.

766
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,390
Listen up, you all.

767
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,920
[Jingming Garden]

768
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,070
Everyone going in and out of here

769
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,310
must be thoroughly checked

770
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,150
and rechecked,

771
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,110
especially that Prince of Zhennan.

772
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,350
Whenever he comes out of this gate,

773
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,630
you all need to keep a close eye on him

774
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,290
and monitor him carefully...

775
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,040
To ensure his safety.

776
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,230
Do you understand?

777
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:09,870
[Jingming Garden]

778
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,070
Yes, My Lord!

779
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,409
Come on, the umbrella.

780
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,590
I don't want to get tanned.

781
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,110
My Lord!

782
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,760
My Lord!

783
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,710
My Lord, something terrible has happened!

784
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,760
What's so terrible?

785
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,360
Everything seems fine to me.

786
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,230
It's not like

787
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,110
the Prince of Zhennan
could disappear, right?

788
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,310
The Prince of Zhennan

789
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,719
has indeed disappeared.

790
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,330
Brother!

791
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,800
I'm sorry, Brother.

792
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,890
I shouldn't have taken your place
as the secondary officiant.

793
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,420
What are you talking about?

794
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,050
I'm not displeased at all.

795
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,920
Seeing you grown up
and becoming so sensible

796
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,940
makes me happy.

797
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,920
Besides, for my sake,

798
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,760
you even risked angering His Majesty.

799
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,110
That proves I still hold

800
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,630
an important place in your heart.

801
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,550
Of course.

802
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,570
That being said, between us brothers,

803
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,840
does it matter who serves as
the secondary officiant?

804
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,560
I'm just worried that those officials

805
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,810
and the common people

806
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,510
will gossip about you behind your back.

807
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,630
Then let them be.

808
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,770
You've done nothing wrong,

809
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,430
so you shouldn't feel guilty.

810
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,440
Have you

811
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,040
grown even taller recently?

812
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,110
It seems I've grown quite a bit indeed.

813
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:11,740
Suige!

814
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,640
Why are you here?

815
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,030
While the guards were changing shifts,

816
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,630
Xia Jingshi slipped out
through the back door.

817
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,130
Wu Ying pays respect to Your Eminence.

818
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,150
[Wu Ying from the death camp]

819
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,930
In enemy territory,

820
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,700
one must act with caution in all matters.

821
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,420
One careless moment

822
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,420
could leave you dead with no burial.

823
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,400
You've remained undercover until now

824
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
without Susha detecting anything.

825
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,610
Good job.

826
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,190
Thank you, Your Eminence.

827
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,160
After the wedding,

828
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,920
I'll find a way to leave Yujing.

829
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,240
While I'm not here,

830
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,460
you'll lead our men

831
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,990
and coordinate with Susha.

832
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,340
Take this

833
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,030
and make contact at the alley
behind the dance house.

834
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,890
Your Eminence,

835
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,630
why must we

836
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,760
risk our lives for those Susha people?

837
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,000
I spoke out of turn.

838

[Jingming Garden]

839
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,800
So that's what happened.

840
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,710
You couldn't even keep watch
over one person.

841
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,830
If His Lordship blames us,

842
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,480
none of you can escape punishment!

843
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,150
And you all!

844
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,550
On my very first day in office,

845
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,960
you already embarrassed me.

846
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,670
And you too!

847
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,540
He's back.

848

[Jingming Garden]

849
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,570
Where have you been?

850
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,840
Why should I report to you

851
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,230
where I went?

852
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,960
Who did you just meet?

853
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,960
I felt stifled in there,
so I went for a walk.

854
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,820
Well, I came to Susha

855
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,820
for the marriage alliance,

856
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,840
not as a hostage.

857
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,320
First Prince, it seems
you're in no position

858
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,880
to restrict my freedom, are you?

859
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,480
I was just worried about you.

860
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,500
If you were careless

861
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,810
and died on some street out there,

862
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,040
that would be bad.

863
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,040
Are you threatening me?

864
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,880
So what if he is?

865
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,480
In Jinxiu, you're the Prince of Zhennan.

866
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,070
But here, you're nothing more than

867
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,110
a son-in-law marrying into
the royal family.

without my written order,

no one is to leave his side
even for a moment.

If he slips away again,

875
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,880
I'll have your heads.

How was that?

00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,580
Was my authority convincing?

882
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,110
Make sure you keep a close eye on him.

883
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,070
Rest assured.

[Jingming Garden]

885
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,530
That was obviously a dead-end valley,

886

but when I caught up,

887
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,010
Xia Jingshi had vanished.

888
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,630
Later, I searched

889
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,560
all the nearby streets and alleys,

890
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,710
but still couldn't find

891
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,640
any trace of him.

892
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,580
It's my incompetence.

893
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,930
Please punish me, Your Highness.

894
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,720
It's not your fault.

895
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,590
Xia Jingshi's escape this time

896
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,710
wasn't an accident.

897
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,310
He planned it in advance.

898
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,360
Someone must have been

899
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,020
helping him from the outside.

900
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,930
But with the wedding approaching,

901
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,280
why would Xia Jingshi

902
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,160
choose to take a risk at such a timing?

903
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,760
Besides, what could he have done

904
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,890
in such a short time?

905
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,280
Or perhaps...

906
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,560
He went to meet someone?

907
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,490
Your Highness!

908
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:00,840
Your Highness.

909
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,510
Any news?

910
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,150
Yes.

911
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,650
I checked every woman

912
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,780
who resembles the one

913
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,510
in the portrait

914
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,240
and is of similar age

915
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,400
throughout Yujing City,

916
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,090
and I finally pinpointed

917
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,670
a top performer in the dance house
named Ruyan.

918
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,360
She must be the one

919
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
we're looking for.

920
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,620
Prepare the carriage.

921
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,910
I'll go see for myself.

922
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,310
Drink a bit more.

923
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,360
Can't you let me take a break?

924
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:22,920
If the medicine gets cold,

925
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,180
it'll lose its effect.

926
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,820
Father, drink it while it's warm.

927
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,150
Father,

928
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,460
what's this medicine you're taking?

929
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,440
Father, are you unwell?

930
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,150
Why haven't I

931
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,610
heard anything from the Imperial Hospital?

932
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,070
Does Mother

933
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,070
know about this?

934
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,400
Allow me to take a break.

935
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,270
I'll drink it later.

936
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,290
These are

937
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,100
just some calming medicines.

938
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,960
My child.

939
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,110
How come you're showing me

940
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,510
such filial piety today?

941
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,400
My wedding day is approaching.

942
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,670
I'm reluctant to leave you, Father.

943
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,510
What's there to be reluctant about?

944
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,190
You're just marrying

945
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,710
the Prince of Zhennan, aren't you?

946
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,400
Besides,

947
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,090
you won't be far from me,

948
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,450
so why the reluctance?

949
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,880
But still, I can't always be

950
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,010
by your and Mother's side to serve you.

951
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,070
Could it be that

952
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,760
you don't like having me by your side,
Father?

953
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,560
Of course I do.

954
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,550
How could I not?

955
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,230
Then why did you say all that?

956
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,160
I just

957
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,360
don't want you to worry.

958
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,150
Remember,

959
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,700
after you're married,

960
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,250
no matter what happens,

961
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,320
you must let me know.

962
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,070
I'll always be your support.

963
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,710
The entire Susha

964
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,230
is your support.

965
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,980
Do you understand?

966
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,120
I understand.

967
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,460
Thank you, Father.

968
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,150
Well, I won't drink this.

969
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,680
Give me a massage, will you?

970
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,330
Remember to drink it later.

971
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,150
All right.

972
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,880
Daughters are the best.

973
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,710
Your Majesty.

974
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,980
[Su]

975
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,320
The token has been retrieved.

976
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,550
Shall I put it back to its original place?

977
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,980
[Su]

978
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,580
Yes, put it back.

979
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,080
Your Highness.

980
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,550
His Majesty hasn't been

981
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,160
this happy for many days.

982
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,670
Forgive me for speaking out of turn again.

983
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,840
I shall take my leave now.

984
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,370
Thank you for your service.

985
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,500
Father, if you're tired,

986
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,670
close your eyes and rest for a while.

987
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,400
All right.
