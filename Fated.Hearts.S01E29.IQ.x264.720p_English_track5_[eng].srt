190
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,370
You should stop caring about me.

191
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,430
Ning Fei,

192
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,320
I came to the Storm Alliance

193
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,780
specifically to find you.

194
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,390
Although your physical wounds have healed,

195
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,030
your emotional wounds haven't.

196
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,950
No matter what,

197
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,840
I need to

198
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,040
heal you completely.

199
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,850
Elder Zhou.

200
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,080
You saved Ning Fei's life.

201
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,870
But he's been

202
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,280
[Shennong's Materia Medica]

203
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,550
so melancholy. How can that be?

204
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,190
Could you please help me talk to him?

205
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,010
[Shennong's Materia Medica]

206
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,500
[Zhou Hao,
Elder of Studying Branch, Storm Alliance]

207
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,240
Heaven, earth, and all things

208
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,480
are the same.

209
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,600
Whether he should feel joy or sorrow

210
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,800
should not be forced.

211
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,720
Just let him follow his heart.

212
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,940
Elder Zhou,

213
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,240
Lord Ling brought a patient here.

214
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,080
The situation is serious.

215
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,360
He's been placed in the treatment room.

216
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,960
Alright, I'll go take a look.

217
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,920
Elder Feng,

218
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,390
are my father and the others here?

219
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:29,790
Yes.

220
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,270
He's in the treatment room.

221
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:31,870
Ning Fei,

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
my father is here.

223
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,840
Come.

224
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,550
I'll take you to meet

225
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,280
the person who saved your life.

226
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,370
Let's go.

227
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,270
Lord Ling,

228
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
you said he wouldn't last five days.

229
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,630
How is he now?

230
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,930
Don't worry.

231
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,390
Elder Zhou of the Storm Alliance

232
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,840
practices medicine differently from me.

233
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,870
His methods are unorthodox.

234
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,800
He'll surely find a way to save him.

235
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,580
Father!

236
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,910
Sister.

237
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,150
Elder Zhou, the patient is here.

238
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,680
Alright, let me take a look.

239
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,350
Yixiao?

240
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,510
Ning Fei.

241
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,720
Feng Suige?

242
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,810
He is Feng Suige?

243
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,270
He's Feng Pingcheng's son, right?

244
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:57,630
Girl.

245
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,890
-I'll kill him!
-Girl!

246
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,940
Calm down.

247
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,100
Let me explain.

248
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,700
Let me explain!

249
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:11,200
[Storm Alliance]

250
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,270
Why did you stop me

251
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,550
from killing Feng Suige?

252
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,630
For such a serious matter,

253
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,320
we should wait for Elder Lei's approval.

254
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
I brought him here.

255
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,030
If you don't save him,

256
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,220
[Lei Lie, Elder of Woodcutting Branch,
Storm Alliance]

257
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,150
I must take him away.

258
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,480
Don't waste your words.

259
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,670
Lord Ling,

260
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,960
I understand

261
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,750
everything you said.

262
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,770
Since you understand,

263
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,360
will you save him or not?

264
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,960
Why did you ask
when you already know the answer?

265
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,150
Back then, Feng Pingcheng sent troops

266
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,200
to wipe out the Storm Alliance.

267
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,930
We suffered heavy casualties.

268
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,670
The Storm Alliance and the Feng family
are sworn enemies.

269
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,030
Bringing a Feng descendant

270
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,230
to the Storm Alliance

271
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,020
is asking for death.

272
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:44,960
But don't forget,

273
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,600
Feng Suige is also

274
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,510
Wei Qingyu's son.

275
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,310
But he still bears the Feng name!

276
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,550
Anyone from the Feng family

277
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,480
is our Storm Alliance's

278
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,410
mortal enemy.

279
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,670
Elders,

280
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
what do you think?

281
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,390
I'll listen to my godfather.

282
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,750
I'm a doctor.

283
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,150
I don't want to stand by
and let someone die.

284
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,120
Why don't you

285
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,110
make the decision yourselves?

286
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,120
Rules are rules.

287
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,720
Fine.

288
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,810
Today we'll follow the rules.

289
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,850
The Fengs are our enemies.

290
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,120
I'll kill Feng Suige for revenge!

291
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,510
Storm Alliance was founded

292
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,930
[Great Shelter Hall]

293
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,240
by Feng Suige's mother.

294
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,720
Everyone in the Alliance

295
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,240
has benefited from her kindness.

296
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,120
The current four elders are led

297
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,070
by Lei Lie from the Woodcutting Branch.

298
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,000
And Elder Lei hates the Fengs most.

299
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,000
But for my father's sake,

300
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,870
they shouldn't make things too hard

301
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,280
for Feng Suige.

302
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,750
Lord Ling once told me

303
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,450
never to reveal his identity.

304
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,150
I'm afraid
he can't resolve this matter either.

305
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,890
I'll go in and take a look.

306
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,850
[Great Shelter Hall]

307
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,750
Ning Fei.

308
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,860
You can't go.

309
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,870
You're now a member of the Storm Alliance.

310
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,530
You can't openly help Yixiao.

311
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,530
[Great Shelter Hall]

312
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,670
Stop!

313
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,840
Get out of my way.

314
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,860
I failed Yixiao.

315
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,080
If you kill him,

316
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,630
after you die,

317
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,870
how will you face Qingyu?

318
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,480
You can't enter!

319
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,410
You cannot go in!

320
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,200
Feng Suige's mother

321
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,130
once showed kindness to all of you.

322
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,080
Now her son's life is hanging by a thread.

323
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,120
Not only do you refuse to save him,

324
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,630
but you also want to kill him.

325
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,440
Isn't this
repaying kindness with betrayal?

326
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Years ago, Feng Pingcheng

327
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,720
killed Qingyu despite their marriage bond,

328
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,360
then sent troops

329
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,910
to wipe out our Storm Alliance.

330
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,840
That blood debt

331
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,670
falls on Feng Suige.

332
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,840
A son paying for his father's sins

333
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,770
is only natural.

334
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,390
You probably don't know

335
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,030
the full truth.

336
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,980
Feng Suige's mother

337
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,390
was killed by Susha's Prime Minister,

338
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,200
Zhuang Shen.

339
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,730
How do you know this?

340
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,360
I heard it with my own ears,

341
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,480
witnessed it with my own eyes,

342
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,510
and personally helped Feng Suige

343
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,710
capture Zhuang Shen.

344
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,650
Everyone in Susha knows

345
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,870
that the First Prince Feng Suige

346
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,070
executed Zhuang Shen

347
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,930
and cleared his mother's name.

348
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,560
Feng Suige avenged his mother.

349
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,720
And you elders

350
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,840
of the Storm Alliance—

351
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,370
not only did you do nothing,

352
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,120
you didn't even figure out
who your true enemy was.

353
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,880
Regardless,

354
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,670
he is still Feng Pingcheng's son.

355
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,480
He has the Feng family blood

356
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,680
flowing in his veins.

357
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,950
Are you sure

358
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,750
it was Feng Pingcheng who ordered

359
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,610
the attack on the Storm Alliance?

360
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,390
I heard him myself say

361
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,030
he never took your Storm Alliance

362
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,850
seriously.

363
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,200
If he had truly decided

364
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,860
to wipe out the Storm Alliance

365
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,950
and sent his army,

366
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,880
none of you would be alive today.

367
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,770
Tell me—

368
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,030
Feng Suige's mother

369
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,490
was killed by Zhuang Shen,

370
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,200
so who is it

371
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,240
that fears your secret revenge

372
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,360
and wants to wipe out
the Storm Alliance completely?

373
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,030
Nonsense!

374
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,600
You're just making up lies

375
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,870
to save Feng Suige!

376
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,260
Enough. Stop arguing.

377
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Allow me a moment

378
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,140
to weigh whether this is true.

379
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,320
Keep Feng Suige under guard for now.

380
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,670
Elder Lei,

381
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,870
you cannot be soft-hearted.

382
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,210
Since Big Brother said so,

383
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,450
let's think it over

384
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,940
before making a decision.

385
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,470
I'll make this clear:

386
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,880
if you want to kill Suige,

387
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,800
you'll have to kill me first.

388
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,400
I'll go check on him.

389
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,480
Zhou Hao!

390
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
If you dare try

391
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,390
to save Feng Suige,

392
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,790
don't blame me for being harsh with you.

393
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,630
[Storm Alliance]

394
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,600
How is he?

395
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,560
Is there any way to treat him?

396
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,670
I'm just here to check on him.

397
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,640
Those three elders haven't agreed,

398
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,200
so I can't treat him.

399
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,540
Sifang Elixir?

400
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,230
Zhou, what are you...

401
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,830
Keep quiet.

402
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,760
Feng Suige's condition doesn't look good.

403
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,910
Put this under his tongue.

404
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,310
It will help him hold on
for a few more days.

405
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,960
Hurry.

406
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,850
Thank you, Elder Zhou.

407
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,030
Elder Zhou,

408
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,270
can you find any way

409
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,110
to make an exception?

410
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,960
I'll do anything

411
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,420
as long as you can save him.

412
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,320
I want to save him too.

413
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm alone

414
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,880
and none of my family

415
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,030
died in that siege,

416
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,400
but Elder Lei

417
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,370
and Elder Zhang

418
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,750
watched

419
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,480
their children

420
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,640
die in that siege.

421
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
Their hatred of the Feng family

422
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,000
runs too deep.

423
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,720
Reconciling that hatred

424
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,930
will be extremely difficult.

425
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,240
Zhou.

426
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,400
I'll go to your place
to get some medicine.

427
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,170
Help me out.

428
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,750
Sister.

429
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,520
Although Ning Fei didn't say it,

430
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,880
I know in his heart

431
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,280
he must feel very guilty.

432
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,710
What happened to him?

433
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,880
He seems like
a completely different person.

434
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,880
It was Elder Zhou

435
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
who saved Ning Fei back then.

436
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,440
When he woke up,

437
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,030
he even asked why he bothered saving him,

438
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,920
saying it would've been better
to let him die.

439
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,750
Later, Elder Feng

440
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,610
took him into the Farming Branch.

441
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,510
Every day, apart from working the fields,

442
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,710
he just sits in a daze,

443
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,360
hardly speaking a word.

444
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,210
He believes that

445
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,590
since his brothers,

446
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,350

447
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,350
his prince,

448
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,270
and everything he believed in
and stood for

449
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,310
are all gone,

450
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,640
he might as well be dead.

451
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,590
Once Feng Suige

452
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,120
pulls through this ordeal,

453
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,480
I'll try to talk some sense into him.

454
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,350
Alright.

00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,960
the situation

539
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,290
Please tell me about it.

540
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,070
Feng Suige has never

541
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,110
told me about it.

542
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,640
When his mother founded

543
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,840
the Storm Alliance, he was still young.

544
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,570
He doesn't know much about many things.

545
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,440
Back then,

546
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,500
Qingyu was helping Feng Pingcheng
fight for power.

547
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,340
Once she was seriously injured.

548
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,790
Feng Pingcheng

549
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,960
brought her to Zhengnian Villa,

550
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,160
asking me to save her.

551
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,440
But before she fully recovered,

552
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,070
Feng Pingcheng rushed back
to the battlefield.

553
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,110
I spared no effort

554
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,570
and finally saved Qingyu.

555
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,510
I remember after she woke up,

556
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,110
she told me

557
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
she felt like she had died once,

558
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,240
and that many of the things
she had once clung to

559
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,680
no longer mattered.

560
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,880
I feel as if I have died once.

561
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,310
Only after walking through hell

562
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,570
did I truly understand

563
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,750
how precious life is.

564
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,000
I can understand that feeling.

565
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,830
When I fell off the cliff,

566
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,450
it felt like I had died once too.

567
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,640
You and Qingyu

568
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,330
are both brave and resourceful heroines,

569
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,680
with great abilities

570
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
but not arrogant.

571
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,760
And both of you are compassionate.

572
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,050
After Qingyu recovered,

573
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,000
she grew weary of war

574
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,960
and stayed at Zhengnian Villa to help.

575
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,400
And in doing so,

576
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,640
she saw much of the suffering

577
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,830
caused by war.

578
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,790
Mom!

579
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,550
Zhengnian Villa

580
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,070
has its own rules.

581
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,680
The wounded I take in

582
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,770
are treated regardless of faction,

583
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,270
and no fighting is allowed.

584
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,750
So enemies who were killing each other

585
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,410
on the battlefield yesterday

586
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,800
must live

587
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,070
peacefully

588
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,090
in my villa today.

589
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,070
The warriors fight
because they have no choice.

590
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,240
No one likes war,

591
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,660
and no one

592
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,470
wants to suffer from war.

593
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,200
If they can coexist peacefully,

594
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,790
why wouldn't they?

595
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,110
That was

596
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,520
when Chief Wei

597
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,720
had the idea
to establish the Storm Alliance?

598
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,520
That's right.

599
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,680
Qingyu realized that the warring sides

600
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,200
could reconcile.

601
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,480
She told me

602
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,830
that although she couldn't stop the war

603
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,890
single-handedly,

604
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,750
at the very least she could treat

605
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,070
the wounded and displaced,

606
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,870
giving them a chance to survive.

607
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,400
So the Storm Alliance

608
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,310
was meant to be a utopia,

609
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,550
where people could fish, farm, work,

610
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,610
and study in peace.

611
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,960
Exactly.

612
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,160
But since Qingyu was gone,

613
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
what has the Storm Alliance become?

614
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,960
It's become filled with hatred—

615
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,900
hatred toward the Feng family

616
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,400
and Susha.

617
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,990
[Storm Alliance]

618
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,490
I feel as if I have died once.

619
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,750
Only after walking through hell

620
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,010
did I truly understand

621
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,310
how precious life is.

622
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:04,670
[Storm Alliance]

623
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,750
With dark skies and stormy weather,

624
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,410
the roosters keep on crowing.

625
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,020
This place should be called

626
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,150
the Storm Alliance.

627
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,160
[Storm Alliance]

628
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,740
Greetings, Elder Lei.

629
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,270
I'm sorry for disturbing you

630
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,730
with my late-night visit.

631
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,590
You're here to plead for Feng Suige?

632
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,520
You want to say

633
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,240
that what happened back then
had nothing to do with the Fengs

634
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,440
and to persuade me to let go of my grudge?

635
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,500
Feng Suige didn't do anything wrong.

636
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,350
He didn't choose

637
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,800
to be the son of Feng Pingcheng.

638
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,000
This is his fate.

639
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,030
My two sons

640
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,870
both died in the siege back then.

641
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,530
What did they do wrong?

642
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,000
Do the grudges of the previous generation

643
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,790
really have to make

644
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,440
this generation

645
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,640
bear the full burden?

646
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,440
I know exactly what kind of person

647
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,960
Feng Pingcheng is.

648
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,400
Not a single person in the Feng family

649
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,550
is decent.

650
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,070
Feng Suige is different from his father.

651
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,400
If he were truly like Feng Pingcheng,

652
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,510
obsessed with power,

653
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,350
he would have already become

654
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,880
the emperor of Susha by now.

655
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,030
He has never harmed

656
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,230
any innocent person.

657
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
He shouldn't have to

658
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,270
unjustly pay

659
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,120
for faults that aren't his.

660
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,590
I don't care what kind of person he is.

661
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,310
I only know

662
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,270
he is my enemy.

663
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:29,440
[Storm Alliance]

664
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,790
Elder Lei,

665
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,480
why was

666
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,030
the Storm Alliance founded
in the first place?

667
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,590
Why was it called the Storm Alliance?

668
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,320
What was its original purpose?

669
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,810
What are you trying to say?

670
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,280
I brought Feng Suige here back then

671
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,040
because I held hope in my heart.

672
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:38,750
I didn't know

673
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,110
what kind of place this was.

674
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,720
I only heard

675
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,120
the name Storm Alliance,

676
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,070
heard that there might be a chance

677
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,270
to save Feng Suige,

678
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,060
and came without hesitation.

679
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,680
Shouldn't this

680
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,510
be a paradise

681
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,750
that shelters all and protects people

682
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,920
from the storm?

683
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,960
From now on,
this will be a place that shelters all

684
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,960
and protects people from the storm.

685
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,480
I heard that back then, Chief Wei

686
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,010
founded the Storm Alliance

687
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,890
to give those who were displaced,

688
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,160
who could see

689
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,480
no hope of survival,

690
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,550
a place to settle again,

691
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,200
a place where they could live
and work in peace

692
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
in chaotic times.

693
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,480
Although I've never met her,

694
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,510
I admire her.

695
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:19,920
Throughout my life,

696
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,120
I've also experienced many hardships.

697
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,110
It's precisely because
I've been caught in the rain

698
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,510
that I can't bear to watch others

699
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,440
struggle helplessly in the storm.

700
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,240
If I have the ability

701
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,700
to save someone in danger,

702
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,000
I will do everything in my power to help.

703
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,030
If Feng Suige's mother

704
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,030
were still alive,

705
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,350
I believe

706
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,720
she would do the same.

707
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,520
Those who bring warmth to others

708
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,160
must not be left to freeze in the snow.

709
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,960
Feng Suige's mother

710
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,790
saved so many people

711
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,270
through the Storm Alliance.

712
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,000
Her son

713
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,240
shouldn't have

714
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,240
to lose his chance to live like this.

715
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:52,960
I believe

716
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,550
the original purpose
of founding the Storm Alliance

717
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,680
was to let those

718
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,480
suffering in the cold and hunger

719
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,140
see light in the darkness—

720
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,680
to give the homeless people

721
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,640
hope

722
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,680
and to help them survive.

723
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,510
Without her,

724
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,270
many of us

725
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,230
wouldn't be alive today.

726
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,880
So...

727
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,800
are you saying you're willing to save
Feng Suige?

728
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,200
Mention my father and my brother again

729
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,680
and see what happens!

730
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,630
Your Majesty.

731
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,400
Do you want to die?

732
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:05,880
Get out!

733
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,480
Get out!

734
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,610
All of you, get out!

735
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,030
Stop right there!

736
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,470
How dare you barge into Shengfu Palace?

737
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,950
Who's causing trouble here?

738
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,550
Your Majesty,

739
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,880
the Princess of Zhennan
is trying to force her way in.

740
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,610
Outrageous!

741
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,720
Let her in.

742
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,710
[Shengfu Hall]

743
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,240
[Shengfu Hall]

744
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,070
Princess of Zhennan
barging into Shengfu Palace?

745
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,750
How dare you?

746
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,920
I've already told you—

747
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,450
I've divorced Xia Jingshi.

748
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,960
I'm no longer Princess of Zhennan.

749
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,620
Don't ever call me that again.

750
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,070
Did you really divorce Xia Jingshi?

751
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,260
Bai Shouzhuo.

752
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,720
My useless brother

753
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,980
was really abandoned?

754
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,440
Good!

755
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,990

00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,920
Feng Chengyang ascends the throne,

948
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,630
you'll become the Grand Princess of Susha,

949
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,770
representing Susha's image abroad.

950
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,230
It seems to you,

951
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,400
who I am doesn't matter,

952
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,630
nor does whether Prince of Zhennan

953
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,360
and I get along.

954
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,170
What matters is my status.

955
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,440
You're a smart woman.

956
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,880
I like talking to smart people.

957
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,070
Your sudden misfortune

958
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,440
made you lose your bearings,

959
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,240
so I'll overlook your rashness.

960
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,680
Go back, show humility, and apologize

961
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,910
to Prince of Zhennan.

962
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,210
You'll still be Princess of Zhennan.

963
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,690
As long as you obey,

964
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,670
I'm willing to be your protector.

965
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,710
If I'm not mistaken,

966
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,480
that's how you

967
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,960
took advantage
of Xia Jingshi's weakness back then

968
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,150
and gradually

969
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:09,480
brought him under your control, isn't it?

970
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,510
He's a man who knows how to adapt.

971
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,480
I hope you are too.

972
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,920
Then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

973
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,590
I've always

974
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,480
made a habit

975
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,280
of taking control of my own fate.

976
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,110
Marrying Xia Jingshi

977
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,040
was my decision.

978
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,760
Taking Xia Jingshi away from Susha

979
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,920
was my decision.

980
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,490
Divorcing him

981
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,270
was also my decision.

982
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,670
Since I've decided

983
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,000
to cut all ties with him,

984
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,800
even if it costs me my life,

985
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,440
I'll never change my mind.

986
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,920
I gave you a chance,

987
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,760
but you refused it.

988
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,400
Don't regret it later.

989
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,480
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

990
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,150
However,

991
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,110
aside from my father and brother,

992
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,000
I need no one's protection.

993
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,110
I, Feng Xiyang,

994
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,320
am my own protector.
