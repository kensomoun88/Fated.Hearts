00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:28,750
Yes.

194
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,120
Come with me.

195
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,320
What happened?

196
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,920
Just come!

197
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,000
Your Highness,

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,460
Miss Yixiao

199
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,440
is leaving with those kids.

200
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,750
Their carriage is at the door now.

201
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,120
We can still catch up with them.

202
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,000
The city gate will be closed soon.

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,030
We have to set out now,
or they'll be gone!

204
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,630
Hands off!

205
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,840
Yun Fang,

206
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,750
Send two guards

207
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,670
to escort them.

208
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,410
Tell the guys to lay low.

209
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,270
Yujing City is facing
many uncertainties now.

210
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,450
They won't be safe until they're away.

211
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,270
Yes.

212
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,170
I hope Miss Yixiao will understand

213
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,800
what Your Highness's efforts are for
someday.

[Wutong Mansion]

216
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,390
It wasn't until they camped at night

217
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,000
did I notice

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,230
Miss Yixiao was nowhere to be seen.

219
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,240
She must have secretly

220
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,400
gotten off the carriage halfway.

221
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,230
Your Highness,

222
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,360
it seems Miss Yixiao and her fellows

223
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,960
didn't leave the city at all.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
What about Miss Ling and the children?

225
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:50,960
I've already sent people

226
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,200
to continue protecting them,

227
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,790
to make sure

228
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,990
they arrive at Zhengnian Villa safely.

229
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,390
Why don't I have some people

230
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,720
go look for Miss Yixiao?

231
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,770
No need.

232
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,090
Do you know where she was off to?

233
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,210
How am I supposed to know?

234
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,310
Are we not going to look for her?

235
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,640
If anyone asks about her,

236
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,770
just tell them this—

237
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,840
Fu Yixiao has gone
with Young Mistress Ling

238
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,060
to Zhengnian Villa.

239
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,450
-Yes.
-Yes.

243
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,010
has seen this mask, right?

244
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,910
You specifically asked me

245
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,720
to keep it secret.

246
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,440

Hello, Miss Ruyan.

These gentlemen

262
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,080
have been waiting here since yesterday.

263
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,390
Too bad that they haven't realized

264
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,030
not everyone

265
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,510
gets to see you dance.

266
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,600
Oh, right.

267
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,290
A lady just came to the dance house,

268
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,620
asking to meet with you.

269
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,420
A lady?

270
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,790
However,

271
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,720
I don't know

272
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,740
where she is now.

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
Miss, you do

274
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,790
recognize this mask.

275
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,460
W-What an unconventional mask.

276
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,510
Is it yours?

277
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,080
After the Battle of Pingling,

278
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,510
someone took your carriage

279
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,110
to the Jinxiu military camp.

280
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,560
Do you remember that?

281
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,800
What are you talking about?

282
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,360
I don't understand.

283
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,470
You don't?

284
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,270
That day, you had that girl

285
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,320
go to the back alley to deliver a note.

286
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
She also read what was written on it.

287
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,160
"Stand by outside Yujing City."

288
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,630
Why would the death camp

289
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,200
follow your orders?

290
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,010
Miss, you must be mistaken.

291
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,420
What "death camp"?

292
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,510
I'm just a dancer.

293
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,730
Still in denial, huh?

294
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,530
That girl already confessed.

295
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,840
Tell me

296
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,040
everything you know.

297
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,960
Or I won't be nice to you.

298
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,260
I've told you I know nothing!

299
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,080
You just won't tell, right?

300
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,750
Then there's no choice

301
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,870
but to talk somewhere else.

302
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,750
As I said,

303
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,720
I know nothing.

304
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,670
Abducting me won't help.

305
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,800
Kill me, if you have the guts.

306
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,940
You want to die?

307
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,350
I'll grant your wish.

308
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,750
Not there.

309
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Aim for this spot.

310
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,850
Slit it with all your strength.

311
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,250
The pain will disappear within an instant.

312
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,570
You'll only feel extremely cold
all over your body.

313
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,230
Then you'll get drowsy.

314
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,520
Very sleepy, I'd say.

315
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,600
Ending a life...

316
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,180
is actually easier

317
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,550
than it sounds.

318
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,650
What now?

319
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,600
Can't bring yourself to do it?

320
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,510
Then don't pretend

321
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,510
not to fear death.

322
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,150
After all, nothing can be

323
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,520
more important than staying alive.

324
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,450
Don't you agree?

325
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,690
I've told you

326
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,670
I know nothing.

327
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,470
I did have a note delivered,

328
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,440
but I really didn't know

329
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,270
the content.

330
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,870
Also, I don't understand

331
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,720
a single word of what you just said.

332
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,580
Did he ask you to deliver the note?

333
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,550
I'm curious.

334
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,310
What's your relationship with him?

335
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,079
All you need to know is

336
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,599
that I'll never betray him.

337
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,960
I'd rather die

338
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,000
than sell him out.

339
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,310
Such admirable loyalty.

340
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,270
You're so devoted to him.

341
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,599
Are you in love with him?

342
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,450
Look at you,

343
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,440
completely lovestruck.

344
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,970
You defend him all the time.

345
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
I guess I'm right.

346
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,750
I won't tell you who he is.

347
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,770
Don't waste your time
fishing for information.

348
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,820
The news of you being abducted

349
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,750
will soon

350
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,590
spread throughout Yujing City.

351
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,040
Venture a guess.

352
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,640
Will that man you fancy
come to your rescue?

353
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,440
You don't seem to be sure

354
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,200
whether he truly cares about you or not.

355
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,060
How about this?

356
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,170
let's make a bet,

357
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,110
on whether he'll come or not.

358
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,670
He... He won't come here.

359
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,850
He's well aware

360
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,750
that I'll never betray him.

361
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,750
I bet he will come,

362
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,550
though not in person.

363
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,520
Instead, he'll send someone

364
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,480
to kill you.

365
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,720
That's impossible.

366
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,330
He won't do that.

367
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,340
Whether you betray him or not,

368
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,130
he'll silence you permanently—

369
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,070
he even doesn't need to do it himself

370
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,480
—because only your death

371
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,920
can guarantee there won't be witnesses,

372
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,050
and that his plans won't be sabotaged.

373
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,170
It can't be true.

374
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,080
He won't have me killed.

375
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,550
You don't believe it?

376
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,240
Then wait and see.

377
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,440
Actually, I deliberately left clues.

378
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,980
I purposefully used your carriage

379
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,070
to bring you here.

380
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,110
Following the carriage tracks,

381
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,310
he'll find this place.

382
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,370
If he doesn't send anyone to kill you,

383
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,700
then I'll set you free.

384
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,640
And I promise to never give you

385
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,970
a difficult time again.

386
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,790
But if things turn out as I said,

387
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,350
you must tell me everything

388
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,270
you know.

389
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Shall we bet on it?

390
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,510
My Lord, you're His Eminence's ally.

391
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,110
May I ask

392
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,510
if His Eminence has safely escaped?

393
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,190
I think he has ordered you all

394
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,040
to do my bidding from now on.

395
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,030
I have one rule here—

396
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,310
you are only to execute my orders,

397
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,910
and not to ask any questions.

398
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes.

399
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,680
My Lord, previously, you asked us

400
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,480
to stand by outside Yujing City.

401
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,770
All the members of the death camp are here

402
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,920
at your service now.

403
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,160
You will find it worthwhile

404
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,560
to risk your lives for me.

405
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,670
When my great mission is accomplished,

406
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,670
you'll all have a share of the glory.

407
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,760
Now, your task

408
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,510
is to kill a person for me.

409
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,210
Your Highness.

410
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,920
Here's a message from Grandmaster Ling:

411
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,590
His Majesty has not yet come to.

412
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,510
Neither has his condition worsened.

413
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,310
Grandmaster Ling
wished you not to worry too much.

414
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,110
I got it.

415
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,140
Concerned about your health,

416
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,160
he made a prescription for you
in particular.

417
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,310
Please have Your Highness's physician
prepare the herbs.

418
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,880
Thanks.

419
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,120
[Licorice roots: 5 grams; Steamed rehmannia roots: 50 grams;
White atractylodes and Chinese angelicad: 25 grams each]

420
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,020
Your Highness.

421
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,880
There was a disturbance
at the dance house.

422
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,790
A dancer named Ruyan

423
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,650
was taken away.

424
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,550
Ruyan?

425
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,120
This must be related to her.

426
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,200
To whom?

427
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,510
Tomorrow, the authorities

428
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,070
will surely search for Ruyan.

429
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,390
Keep an eye on how it develops.

430
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,590
Create some trouble for them in secret.

431
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,210
Just do as I say.

432
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:02,790
Got it.

433
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,200
Miss, do you like any one of them?

434
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,110
This one.

435
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,680
Miss Ruyan

436
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,070
was abducted by a young woman.

437
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,000
You guys, search

438
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,200
each household down the street!

439
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,550
Bring all the women you find suspicious

440
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,480
back to the office!

441
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,140
-Yes!
-Yes!

442
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,790
Miss, wait!

443
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,300
What are you doing?

444
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,410
Officer Lu,

445
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,640
we're ordered by the prefect

446
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,240
to investigate

447
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,830
the abduction of Miss Ruyan.

448
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,400
You're from the Capital Prefecture Office?

449
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,830
Yes.

450
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,550
The Capital Prefecture Office

451
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,400
is responsible for maintaining order
in the capital.

452
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,160
So instead of fulfilling

453
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,240
your duties assigned by His Majesty,

454
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,900
you chose to

455
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,180
waste your time on such trivial matters?

456
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,350
Here is the First Prince's command!

457
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
All of you shall guard

458
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,310
outside the imperial palace.

459
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,290
Do not ask a single question

460
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,270
about those trivial matters.

461
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,070
Do you hear me?

462
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,270
-Yes!
-Yes!

463
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,790
Let's go!

464
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,400
Your Highness,

465
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,000
I've found

466
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,420
the soldier who poisoned

467
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,900
the war horses in our camp.

468
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,380
However...

469
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,350
He must be dead now.

470
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,240
In the woods near our military camp,

471
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,350
we discovered his body.

472
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,000
In his tent,

473
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,800
hidden silver taels were found.

474
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,120
He was probably bribed

475
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,050
and then killed.

476
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,600
If my deduction is correct,

477
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,920
this must be
Prime Minister Zhuang's doing.

478
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,270
I'll go on with the investigation.

479
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:30,960
If we can get something

480
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,920
on him through this case...

481
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,400
No need.

482
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,240
Prime Minister Zhuang is a weasel.

483
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,040
He already killed that soldier.

484
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,880
There is no way he'd leave a trail behind.

485
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Your Highness...

486
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,750
Your Highness,

487
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,920
Shen Wu the Minister of Rites

488
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,450
is requesting an audience.

[Wutong Mansion]

490
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,500
Your Highness,

491
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,510
I was planning

492
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,310
to go to Princess Xiyang's villa

493
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,920
to check and cart the dowry

494
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,850
prepared by Your Highness

495
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,960
before transporting it to Jinxiu.

496
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,030
Since

497
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,750
Your Highness's supervision is needed
in this matter,

498
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,630
I had to come and trouble Your Highness.

499
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,570
Get my horse ready.

500
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,540
I'm leaving for the villa.

501
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,960
[Wutong Mansion]

502
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,750
Yes.

503
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,000
So,

504
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,510
Your Highness is going to
monitor the process

505
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,110
in person?

506
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,550
That's wonderful!

507
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,200
Ahead lies Shengjing City.

508
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,200
Everyone, take a rest here!

509
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:37,880
Yes!

510
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,380
Lift up your head.

before

513
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,150
he could leave a will.

514
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,830
Should I make you the emperor

515
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,400
or let Jingyan take the throne?

516
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,730
Mother,

517
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,110
I'm devoid of the competence

518
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,470
to assume the throne.

519
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,920
But many court officials

520
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,050
think highly of you.

521
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,800
This has truly put me
in a difficult position.

522
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,790
Since you've admitted to
not being qualified for the throne,

523
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,520
I should kindly grant your wish

524
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,960
of guarding Zhennan Pass

528
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,270
when was the last time you came back

529
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,330
to Shengjing City?

530
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,210
A long time ago.

531
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,330
Then I guess this trip

532
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,750
will bring back many memories for you.

grow up.

00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,900
there was a void in my heart.

00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,270
if there's nothing wrong about the list,

570
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,510
I'll load the dowry into the carts.

571
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,040
Go ahead.

572
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,430
[Jingming Garden]

573
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,100
Check one more time.

574
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,030
Cart the items if everything's alright.

575
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,760
Get a move on.

576
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,160
Your Highness,

577
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,200
here's a message from Song Cheng.

578
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,830
Trails of those people

579
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,430
were found outside the city.

580
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,510
There's an ambush. Run!

581
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,610
You recognize those women, don't you?

582
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,730
You've seen for yourself.
I was right, wasn't I?

583
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,010
Spill the beans now.

584
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
I did lose the bet.

585
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,750
But I still won't tell you

586
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,480
who I'm working for.

587
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,620
At this point,

588
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,550
you're still protecting him?

589
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,950
He attempted to kill you.

590
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,170
Yet you still choose to cover for him?

591
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,640
I'm just a dancer.

592
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,050
How could you take the word

593
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,310
of a member of the debased caste?

594
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,100
Nobody would ever miss

595
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,590
someone like me,

596
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,800
even if I died.

597
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,160
Kill me now.

598
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,950
I knew you'd break your word.

599
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,900
But it doesn't matter.

600
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,070
I can still

601
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,590
find out who he is without your help.

602
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,120
Here I am, Miss.

603
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,350
Go, puppy.

604
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,660
They went that way.

605
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,840
Are you sure?

606
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,090
Is it confirmed?

607
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,650
Rest assured.

608
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,980
The scent lingers within the nearby 10 li.

609
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,720
Go!

610
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,960
[Susha Kingdom's Feng Battalion,
Song Cheng]

611
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,410
Your Highness.

612
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,400
What did you find?

613
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,590
I finally found traces of them

614
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,510
after spending 7 days and nights

615
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,640
studying and tracking trails.

616
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,040
This way, Your Highness.

617
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,540
Your Highness.

618
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,270
There's a jumble of footprints here.

619
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,200
At least dozens of people

620
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,660
gathered here last night.

621
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Your Highness, look here.

622
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,960
But...

623
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,970
what can these footprints

624
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
possibly tell us?

625
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,260
Song Cheng

626
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,590
is a top-class tracker.

627
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,110
He used to be a constable
at the Court of Judicial Review.

628
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,030
Then His Highness recruited him

629
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,830
into the army.

630
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,840
He had a nickname back then—

631
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,670
the Clairvoyant Constable.

632
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,110
With just his keen eyes,

633
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,440
he can distinguish foes from friends

634
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,270
by analyzing footprints on a battlefield

635
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,270
where a thousand people have stood.

636
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,650
Your Highness,

637
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,450
this way.

638
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,270
The footprints extend to this very spot

639
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,830
and split up here.

640
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,420
If my judgment is correct,

641
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,390
those people separated here

642
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,080
in order to

643
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,270
set an ambush.

644
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,650
Your Highness,

645
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,080
we'd better stop here

646
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,680
to avoid alerting them.

647
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,280
Yun Fang,

648
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,070
if I'm not mistaken, anyone who is to

649
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,880
reach Yujing

650
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,830
from the Capital Garrison
must take this road.

651
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,630
That's right.

652
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,290
Xia Jingshi has indeed fled from Yujing,

653
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,440
but his death camp still stays put.

654
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,590
These people

655
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,120
are all skilled assassins.

656
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,350
Their mission must be

657
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,080
about assassinating someone.

658
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,170
Hou Jing the Minister of War

659
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:22,720
left for

660
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,200
the Capital Garrison a few days ago
for an inspection.

661
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,860
When will he return to Yujing?

662
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,880
The estimated time of arrival...

663
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,080
is tomorrow morning.

664
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,680
Tomorrow morning...

665
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,410
They're targeting Minister Hou!

666
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,970
We're running out of time.

667
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640

00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,440
You failed?

673
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,770
Fu Yixiao set up a trap.

674
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,410
She's still in Yujing City?

675
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,510
That explains it.

676
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,910
She must've tracked down Ruyan.

677
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,690
Why don't we

678
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,060
find a way to eliminate Fu Yixiao?

679
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,730
You two are no match for her.

680
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,750
Did she find you out?

681
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,080
We took several detours

682
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,070
and made sure no one

683
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,930
was following
before we came back to Your Lordship.

684
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,170
You were found out.

685
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,590
We're ready to be punished

686
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,440
for failing the task, Your Lordship.

687
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,750
The cat is out of the bag.

688
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,550
There's no point punishing you.

689
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Does Your Lordship have a plan then?

[Wutong Mansion]

691
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:21,880
Miss Yixiao?

692
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,110
Shouldn't you be

693
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,320
at Zhengnian Villa now?

694
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,380
You came back without telling Suige?

695
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,139
I get it.

696
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:42,230
You must've missed him too much.

697
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,320
In recent days,

698
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,550
His Majesty's serious condition.

699
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,580
has been upsetting him.

700
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,320
I'm glad you're back.

701
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,780
I hope you can comfort him.

702
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,440
It seems

703
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,170
Ruyan has told you everything.

704
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,070
Aren't you tired?

705
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,630
How am I not?

706
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,360
Then drop the act.

707
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,520
I happen to

708
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,730
have a question for you today.

709
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,030
Feng Suige considers you

710
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,230
his best friend.

711
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,170
Why do you have to hurt him?

712
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:19,550
What?

713
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,930
You don't want to talk here?

714
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,090
Then let's go inside

715
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,570
and talk in front of Feng Suige.

716
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,150
Is it what you want,

717
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,190
to turn me and him against each other?

718
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,510
Am I turning you two

719
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,350
into enemies,

720
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,510
or are you feeling bad
about betraying him?

721
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,880
Why are you colluding

722
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,150
with Xia Jingshi?

723
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,440
Don't worry.

724
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,110
Nothing I do

725
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,420
will cause harm to Feng Suige.

726
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,320
In the Battle of Pingling,

727
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,230
if I hadn't shot Feng Suige

728
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,630
and knocked him off his horse,

729
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,000
he would've entered Zhennan Pass

730
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,010
and died there.

731
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,670
Do you expect me to believe what you said,

732
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,960
that you wouldn't harm him?

733
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,510
If I truly wanted to kill him,

734
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,190
I could have it done in many ways.

735
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,720
He never guards against me.

736
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,280
Answer me.

737
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,280
What exactly do you want?

738
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,740
Be patient.

739
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,650
You'll see soon enough.

740
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,800
Aren't you afraid I'll tell

741
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,560
Feng Suige the whole truth?

742
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,800
Of course I am.

743
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,670
Why else would I be waiting here?

744
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,760
You can tell him

745
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,420
what I'm really like anytime.

746
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,980
But you should know

747
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
that I'm not alone.

748
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,590
I'm only part of a team.

749
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,720
If my cover is blown,

750
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,180
my plan will be executed
ahead of schedule.

751
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,070
[Wutong Mansion]

752
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,680
Let me put it this way.

753
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,710
The moment you step

754
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,370
into Feng Suige's residence,

755
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,800
someone in the imperial palace

756
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,960
will jeopardize His Majesty's life.

757
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,760
Just imagine.

758
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,670
What will happen to Feng Suige,

759
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,090
if His Majesty dies?

760
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,000
He'll not only suffer the pain

761
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,600
of losing his father, right?

762
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
He'll also lose

763
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,190
everything he owns now,

764
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,070
including his life.

765
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,170
Are you threatening me?

766
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,700
You've taken it wrong.

767
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,090
In the past,

768
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,170
I cherished my friendship

769
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,100
with Feng Suige,

770
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,960
so I was reluctant to do anything

771
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,360
that could harm his life.

772
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,670
But if you ever blow my cover,

773
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,550
I'll have to

774
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,350
forsake my friendship with him.

775
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,440
In that case,

776
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,710
I'll have no reason

777
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,840
to hold myself back.

778
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,740
Feng Suige's life
is in the palm of your hand.

779
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,670
I can promise you

780
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,660
that whatever happens in the end,

781
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,200
I'll spare his life.

782
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,660
How about that?

783
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,360
You can make your choice now.

784
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,960
You know what?

785
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,290
I can kill you right now!

786
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,800
When whistling arrows are shot,

787
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,310
[Wutong Mansion]

788
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,200
the emperor will die,

789
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,740
and Susha will be in chaos.

790
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,500
Though you care about Feng Suige,

791
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
you must refrain acting on impulse.

792
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,110
[Log of City's Defenses]

793
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,690
Charge!

794
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,070
Take the shortcut!

795
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,550
Let's go!

796
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,000
Yes!

797
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,590
My Lord, run!

798
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,760
Go after them!

799
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,820
Go check it out.

800
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:15,590
Yes!

801
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,930
Your Highness!

802
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,400
Minister Hou is not here!

803
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,050
Your Highness,

804
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,210
they went that way.

805
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,110
Those people came prepared.

806
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,190
When the fight starts,

807
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,520
stay hidden somewhere.

808
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,190
If an enemy soldier escapes,

809
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,070
you must follow him

810
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,070
to their hideout.

811
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:49,880
Got it!

812
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:58,870
Minister Hou!

813
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,090
-My Lord!
-My Lord!

814
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:02,710
My Lord!

815
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,130
Are you alright, My Lord?

816
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,000
The arrow was dipped in poison.

817
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,440
-Let's go.
-Move!

818
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,240
Who...

819
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,510
are you?

820
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,420
Kill them all!

821
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,760
Feng Suige,

822
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,110
though you're here today,

823
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,510
you can't save Hou Jing's life.

824
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,510
The Jinxiu death camp...

825
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,760
You must be Wu Ying.

826
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,660
I guess Yixiao keeps

827
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,770
no secret from you.

828
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,070
This is perfect.

829
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,710
Today,

830
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,930
it's time we ended all the feuds.

831
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,610
Your Highness must be joking.

832
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,120
How are there any feuds between us?

833
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
If I say there are, there must be.

834
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:26,960
Chief!

835
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,710
Chief!

836
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,190
Your Highness,
I'll go after them with others.

837
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,190
Give it some time.

838
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:54,930
Your Highness!

839
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,070
Minister Hou was shot in the back.

840
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,030
Though it's not a vital spot,

841
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,280
I'm afraid there might be poison
on the arrow.

842
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,440
On our way back to the capital,

843
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,840
who knows what dangers are lying ahead.

844
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,760
Young Mistress Ling

845
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,360
should've arrived
at Zhengnian Villa by now.

846
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:05,960
Bring Minister Hou there

847
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,890
for treatment.

848
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:07,590
Got it.
