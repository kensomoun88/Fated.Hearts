[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,990
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:49,920
Hurry!

4
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,150
Emperor.

5
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,020
[Xia Jingyan, Emperor of Jinxiu]

6
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,000
Fill it up.

7
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,510
Everyone leave!

8
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,829
You two, stop right there!

9
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,340
Raise your heads.

10
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,290
I recognize you.

11
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,800
Last year during the Dragon Boat Festival

12
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,240
at the ceremony by the Qingjiang River,

13
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,540
you two were there too.

14
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,240
One is the wife of

15
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,270
Dai Quan, the Vice Minister of Works.

16
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,840
The other is

17
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,240
the niece of the Marquis of Bao'an.

18
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,970
Why are these two here with you?

19
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,960
Aren't you the wife of

20
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,840
Wang Encheng,
the Vice Minister of Revenue?

21
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,280
How did you become

22
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,010
the Marquis of Bao'an's niece?

23
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,950
Take them away right now!

24
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

25
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,750
Let's go. Hurry up.

26
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,060
There're so many concubines
and beauties in the palace.

27
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,590
Aren't they enough for your debauchery?

28
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,630
You even have to touch
the niece of an official?

29
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,240
How could the concubines and beauties
in the palace

30
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,520
compare to the peerless beauties outside?

31
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,560
But the Marquis of Bao'an's family...

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,420
Mother!

33
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,920
I didn't force them!

34
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,570
They were all willing.

35
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,880
Look at you now.

36
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,780
Do you have any bearing of a ruler?

37
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,780
I've been like this since I was a kid.

38
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,720
Xia Jingshi has the bearing of a ruler,

39
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,690
but do you know where he is now?

40
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,360
I heard there's a letter from Susha.

41
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,250
What did it say?

42
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,660
That Feng Suige is quite interesting.

43
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,330
He wants to keep Xia Jingshi

44
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,990
to stay in Susha permanently,

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,210
saying he loves and cherishes him

46
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,410
even more than his own flesh and blood.

47
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,200
This is just an excuse
to keep Xia Jingshi in Susha

48
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,600
as a son-in-law married into their family.

49
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,550
We absolutely cannot agree to this.

50
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,550
I already agreed.

51
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,839
Nonsense!

52
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,649
How can he, a first-rank prince of Jinxiu,

53
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,510
become a live-in son-in-law

54
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,170
to those barbarians in Susha?

55
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,440
If Xia Jingshi stays in Susha,

56
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,000
wouldn't Pingling City

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,630
naturally return to imperial control?

58
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,480
Or do you think that border stronghold

59
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,060
is better controlled
by powerful ministers, Mother?

60
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,260
If he doesn't return,

61
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,080
I can legitimately

62
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,210
take back his

63
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,080
military and political power
over the Zhennan Army.

64
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,560
That First Prince of Susha

65
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,890
is quite clever indeed.

66
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,200
He could even predict

67
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,170
that I would certainly agree.

68
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,340
Xia Jingshi won't just sit around
and wait for his doom.

69
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,409
How can he possibly
be trapped in Susha forever?

70
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,610
He's bound to come back sooner or later.

71
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,430
By the time he returns,

72
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,750
Pingling City will

73
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,370
no longer belong to him,
the Prince of Zhennan.

74
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,160
Your Highness,

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,020
so you had a backup plan all along.

76
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,150
Having him marrying into our kingdom
is brilliant.

77
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,230
Keeping Xia Jingshi in our Susha means

78
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,920
our princess won't have to marry far away.

79
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,680
This way,

80
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,920
we can preserve the sibling bond

81
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,530
between you and Her Highness,

82
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,430
while also keeping Xia Jingshi

83
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,880
firmly under our control.

84
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,680
I'm afraid Xia Jingshi

85
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,750
never expected that

86
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,670
Your Highness would have
such a brilliant plan.

87
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,680
Since arriving in Susha, Xia Jingshi

88
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,820
has been acting like he has

89
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,350
everything under control.

90
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,510
I'm going to strip away

91
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,240
that hypocrite's

92
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,710
fake facade.

93
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:37,690
That's right.

94
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,800
As long as he stays in Susha,

95
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:40,950
no matter what

96
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,650
he intends to do next,

97
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,580
it's all in vain.

98
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,950
I'm telling you,

99
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,110
His Highness is just one move ahead,

100
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,040
you know?

101
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,890
I truly admire you.

102
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,070
I-I admire you too.

103
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,400
Completely impressed.

104
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,430
So you guys think

105
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,560
victory is assured?

106
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,710
Why don't we set up a celebration feast?

107
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,950
That's a great idea!

108
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,530
Well...

109
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,159
Yun Fang and I

110
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,620
will go prepare the wine and meat
right away.

111
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,090
Why are you stepping on my foot?

112
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,030
Alright, stop it.

113
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,040
We'll have a proper celebration

114
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,640
after we capture him.

115
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,140
Remember,

116
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,640
when people are backed into a corner,

117
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,370
they'll take desperate risks.

118
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,010
Your Highness, you mean

119
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,270
Xia Jingshi would risk

120
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,270
meeting with that traitor of Susha?

121
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,500
That's right.

122
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,730
By the time Jinxiu sends a reply,

123
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,000
it'll be too late to change anything.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,830
Even if Xia Jingshi wants to escape,

125
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,830
it'll be too late.

126
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,300
And for such an important matter,

127
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:30,950
he wouldn't

128
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,390
trust his subordinates
to deliver messages.

129
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,800
He'll have to meet in person.

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,730
Keep a close eye on Zhengnian Hall.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,060
[Zhengnian Hall]

132
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,909
By the way, Ning Fei,

133
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,030
tell me about

134
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,000
what happened after

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,330
the Battle of Pingling.

136
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
Why are you asking about this again?

137
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,800
As for past events,

138
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I need to recall it slowly,

139
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,680
piece by piece.

140
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,080
Please, just help me.

141
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,720
The cliff fall happened

142
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,240
after the Battle of Pingling ended.

143
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,210
I really want to know

144
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,810
what exactly happened then.

145
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,040
At least tell me

146
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,580
what happened on the day
I fell off the cliff.

147
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,350
All right.

148
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,750
Officer Ning.

149
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,210
Have you seen Commander Fu?

150
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,270
Haven't seen her.

151
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,390
Hey, guys.

152
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,040
Have any of you seen Yixiao?

153
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,650
No, no.

154
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,360
Hey, fellows.

155
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,600
Have you seen Yixiao?

156
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,880
No, haven't seen her.

157
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,560
We were drinking and

158
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,630
couldn't find you anywhere.

159
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,240
Hey, guys,

160
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,310
have you seen Commander Fu?

161
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,060
Commander Fu?

162
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,160
I think she went toward

163
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,040
His Highness's military tent.

164
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,560
Okay.

165
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,630
Don't worry.

166
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,030
Come on, let's drink!

167
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,600
Someone said

168
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,360
you went toward
His Highness's military tent.

169
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,190
Weiran and I thought

170
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,730
you must have had something to discuss
with His Highness,

171
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,260
so we didn't go look for you.

172
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,650
What happened next?

173
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,340
Next...

174
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,450
After that, we drank too much

175
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,110
and returned to our own tents.

176
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,750
When I sobered up,

177
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,409
you had already disappeared.

178
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,310
Why are you being so evasive?

179
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,920
That night I got excited from drinking

180
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,430
and got into a fight with someone.

181
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,750
Weiran helped settle the matter

182
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,150
and forced me to go to bed.

183
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,110
Ning Fei,

184
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,960
you're my best friend.

185
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,740
I don't remember anything now.

186
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,140
You mustn't lie to me.

187
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,190
When have I, Ning Fei,

188
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,120
ever lied to you?

189
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,680
Yixiao,

190
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,920
even if you don't remember,

191
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,180
you can't distrust me.

192
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,610
Look,

193
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,400
I swear,

194
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,630
if I speak even one word of lie,

195
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,290
may lightning strike me down!

196
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,400
Stop it.

197
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,670
Do you believe me now?

198
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,940
[You, Xiao Weiran and Ning Fei
are all orphans.]

199
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,780
[The three of you grew up together.]

200
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,150
Do you think what Ning Fei said

201
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,020
is true?

202
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,669
Judging by his demeanor,

203
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,130
he was probably not lying.

204
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,870
But I still need to verify it.

205
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,080
Xia Jingshi is almost recovered

206
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,910
and should return to the inn soon.

207
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,320
What do you plan to do next?

208
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,850
Are you going to ask him directly?

209
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,220
Feng Suige told me

210
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,280
that memories recalled with others' help

211
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
may not be true.

212
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,670
Only what I remember by myself

213
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,870
cannot be falsified.

214
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,880
Even if

215
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,510
I put a knife

216
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,110
to Xia Jingshi's throat now,

217
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,030
he might still not tell the truth.

218
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,030
So you plan to continue pretending?

219
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,220
I need to make him believe

220
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,240
that I've completely returned

221
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,010
to being that Fu Yixiao

222
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,360
who was completely obedient

223
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,670
and loyal to him.

224
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,830
But since he intends to harm you,

225
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,750
he must have prepared

226
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,750
all kinds of lies.

227
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,390
How do you plan to test him?

228
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,600
Don't worry.

229
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,150
Even a goose leaves a trace
when it files by.

230
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,280
There will be flaws.

231
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,960
It's just that

232
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,630
every single moment spent with him

233
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,230
feels painful and repulsive

234
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,390
to me.

235
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,850
What about Ning Fei

236
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,150
and Xiao Weiran?

237
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,630
Could they be part of Xia Jingshi's...

238
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,240
If those two

239
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,720
were also involved in
the attempt to kill me,

240
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,520
I absolutely won't let them off.

241
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,240
But I'm not sure yet.

242
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,740
That fool Ning Fei.

243
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,310
His feelings are written
all over his face.

244
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,840
What evil intentions
could he possibly have?

245
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,790
Prime Minister.

246
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,720
Minister Shen has arrived.

247
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,050
Prime Minister Zhuang.

248
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,640
What does His Majesty think?

249
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,000
His Majesty kept

250
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,730
the First Prince behind alone.

251
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,710
I think

252
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,520
His Majesty just wants to discipline

253
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,680
his son in private.

254
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,120
It also spares

255
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,630
the First Prince some face.

256
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,500
It's good, actually. Let His Majesty

257
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,550
give the First Prince a proper scolding,

258
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,410
so that brat won't

259
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,740
get more foolish ideas.

260
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,510
I didn't mean to say "that brat."

261
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,120
I meant,

262
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,120
His Highness the First Prince.

263
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,680
I misspoke.

264
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,420
I'll...

265
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,030
Slap myself.

266
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,030
You don't even know what you said wrong.

267
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,910
Let me tell you.

268
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,260
His Majesty will agree.

269
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,180
Agree to what?

270
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,790
I know.

271
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,910
His Majesty must have agreed to support me

272
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,080
and make the First Prince

273
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,550
hand over that Fu Yixiao.

274
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,120
Thank you, Your Majesty!

275
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,320
His Majesty will surely agree to
the marriage into the family.

276
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,140
From what I know of His Majesty,

277
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,080
the First Prince's proposal

278
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,290
aligns perfectly with his wishes.

279
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,890
He won't decline it.

280
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,250
So you mean

281
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,640
the Prince of Zhennan will really
marry into our imperial family?

282
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,840
It still depends on Jinxiu's response.

283
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,680
This marriage arrangement

284
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,700
isn't up to the First Prince.

285
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,390
Whether the Prince of Zhennan is willing

286
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,550
doesn't matter either.

287
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,270
Only His Majesty

288
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,000
and the Emperor of Jinxiu's attitudes

289
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,600
will determine the outcome.

290
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,570
However,

291
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,600
the First Prince took it upon himself

292
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,460
to write to the Emperor of Jinxiu.

293
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,200
This matter can be made into
a serious issue.

294
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,840
Do you understand what I mean?

295
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,890
So Xia Jingshi's

296
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,930
future child with Princess Xiyang

297
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
will not bear the surname Xia,

298
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
but will take the surname Feng instead.

299
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,860
Do you understand what I said?

300
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,860
I understand.

301
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,030
I understand completely.

302
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,520
I'll contact my colleagues right away.

303
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,120
We'll make sure to submit a harsh memorial

304
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
against the First Prince tomorrow.

305
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,440
Your Highness,

306
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,500
news just arrived:

307
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,840
our wedding procession

308
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,320
has reached the Susha border.

309
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,650
They will arrive in Yujing City tomorrow.

310
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,120
Using the wedding procession
as an opportunity,

311
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,440
we can urge Susha
to exchange prisoners soon.

312
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,080
This way, we can also take

313
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,960
Yixiao away from here as soon as possible.

314
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,160
Feng Suige is someone

315
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,310
who's hard to read.

316
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,340
I'm afraid if we stay too long,

317
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,270
something unexpected might happen.

318
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,000
Understood.

319
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,310
You've been in Yujing for many days now.

320
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,240
Have you secretly observed

321
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,440
the market of Yujing?

322
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,870
Thriving businesses,

323
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,910
shops everywhere,

324
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,110
with abundant goods.

325
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,190
The Susha Kingdom is much stronger
than I thought.

326
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,670
I've been stationed in
the southern frontier for over 10 years,

327
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,200
fought seven major battles

328
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,980
and countless minor skirmishes
against Susha.

329
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,080
Of the southern frontier's annual taxes,

330
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,810
70% goes to military expenses.

331
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,750
Pingling City, with its modest population
and small garrison,

332
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,670
is nothing compared to
the splendor of Yujing.

333
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,510
Though they were defeated

334
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,970
in the Battle of Pingling,

335
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,490
for Susha, it was merely

336
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,070
a minor irritation

337
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,710
that caused no real damage.

338
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,870
Feng Pingcheng

339
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,790
is a great ruler of his generation.

340
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,650
Your Highness.

341
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,580
In my opinion,

342
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,170
Feng Suige is actually

343
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,270
not at all like

344
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,510
what others describe him to be,

345
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,330
just a bloodthirsty warrior.

346
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,720
On the contrary,

347
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,750
he's impossible to read or figure out.

348
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,360
In fact,

349
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,600
he's more difficult to deal with
than Feng Pingcheng.

350
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,270
Therefore,

351
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,550
Feng Suige absolutely cannot become

352
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,010
the future ruler of Susha.

353
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,700
If he takes the throne,

354
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,440
our Jinxiu

355
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,190
will have no chance of victory.

356
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,200
Your Highness, are you feeling better?

357
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,930
Much better.

358
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,360
Then please drink this bowl of medicine

359
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,620
while it's still warm.

360
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,630
This medicine was personally prepared
by Xueying.

361
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,270
It can help relieve your pain

362
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,730
when the poison flares up.

363
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,570
Ning Fei also

364
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,480
personally brewed it by the stove.

365
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,680
Thank you, Miss Ling.

366
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,370
Your Highness.

367
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,120
Tomorrow, our wedding procession

368
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,750
will arrive.

369
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,360
By then,

370
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,230
your antidote will also be delivered.

371
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,150
In my opinion, perhaps we should wait

372
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,630
and not take any other medicine for now

373
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,760
to avoid conflicts with the antidote.

374
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,780
I've already tested it.

375
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,180
The temperature is just right,
not too hot.

376
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,200
Ning Fei says you never eat breakfast,

377
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,240
but Xueying says

378
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,120
your body is weakened by the poison

379
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,510
and you should eat more nourishing food.

380
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,720
So should I listen to Ning Fei

381
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,770
or to Xueying?

382
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,610
I'll listen to you.

383
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,510
I'll make the call then.

384
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,960
I'll have breakfast prepared.

385
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,420
See you in the dining hall.

386
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,630
Your Highness.

387
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,240
Don't you think...

388
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,700
Enough.

389
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,750
The prescription was written by Miss Ling,

390
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,620
and the medicine was prepared by Ning Fei.

391
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,790
Yixiao just brought it here.

392
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,920
What could be wrong?

393
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,200
I've already failed

394
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,330
Yixiao once before.

395
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,240
Now I'm about to marry

396
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,270
the Princess of Susha.

397
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,870
It will break her heart again.

398
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,960
The fact that she can put aside
past grievances

399
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,420
and return to my side
is already remarkable.

400
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,700
So don't overthink it.

401
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:28,790
Yes.

402
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,240
Yixiao.

403
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,240
I don't remember what

404
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,510
Your Highness likes to eat.

405
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,150
These are all

406
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,510
what Shunzi and others enjoy eating.

407
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,120
I suppose

408
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,520
they suit the taste of us Jinxiu people.

409
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,650
These are all my favorites.

410
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,260
Before,

411
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,120
did we also dine

412
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,780
together with Your Highness?

413
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:57,970
Yixiao,

414
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,460
between us,

415
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
we never cared about rank or status.

416
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,330
Please sit.

417
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:04,960
Yixiao,

418
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,270
do you remember

419
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,200
the first time His Highness

420
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,790
hit you?

421
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,920
His Highness hit me?

422
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,270
You've always been one to hold grudges.

423
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,600
You mentioned it quite often afterwards.

424
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,880
I don't remember at all.

425
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,390
Yixiao,

426
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,340
Weiran is just joking.

427
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,520
At that time,

428
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
you had just joined the Zhennan Army,

429
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,080
and you didn't know my temperament yet.

430
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,430
Once, I took you out,

431
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,390
and there was a shop

432
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,080
displaying all kinds of earrings.

433
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,550
You kept staring at those earrings.

434
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,320
So I asked you

435
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,360
if you liked them

436
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,290
and wanted them.

437
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,240
Interested in these earrings?

438
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,470
In the death camp,

439
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,640
the instructor said
I was a lower-class person.

440
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,770
He told me to always remember

441
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,099
my lower-class status.

442
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,800
I shouldn't dare to dream

443
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,349
of possessing things

444
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,950
that shouldn't belong to me.

445
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,319
Whether commoner or prince,

446
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,280
since we're all born human,

447
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,369
you should know

448
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,859
the value of your own life.

449
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,640
What does it matter if our origins differ?

450
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,369
Aren't we all ordinary people?

451
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,960
Don't we all experience
birth, aging, sickness, death,

452
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,589
joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness?

453
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,400
How can you say

454
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,830
you're a lower-class person?

455
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,490
From now on,

456
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,920
if anyone dares to say

457
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,880
such things to your face,

458
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,010
just take this whip and lash them good.

459
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,710
This is my imperial decree.

460
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,260
Do you understand?

461
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,640
I understand.

462
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,620
Don't be afraid.

463
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,730
Even if one day
you punch a hole in the sky,

464
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,950
I'll always be your support.

465
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,640
Go ahead,

466
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,210
pick a few things you like.

467
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,030
And then I struck you once

468
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,030
with my horsewhip

469
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,690
because I wanted you to remember...

470
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,950
You want me to remember

471
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,530
that I'm not some lower-class person.

472
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,050
Now that Your Highness mentioned it,

473
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,110
I remember now.

474
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,530
What else do you remember?

475
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,530
Xueying said

476
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,350
my memory only comes back

477
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,610
with help from others.

478
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,460
If I rely entirely on myself,

479
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
I won't be able to remember anything
at all.

480
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,210
Your Highness.

481
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,860
Why don't you tell me about

482
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,460
what happened
after the Battle of Pingling?

483
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,390
Your Highness, let me.

484
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,360
That day,

485
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,240
you shot Feng Suige with an arrow,

486
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,510
and our army won a great victory.

487
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,640
That night, you were discussing with me

488
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,440
how your arrow

489
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,650
missed by just a hair

490
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,590
and didn't hit him right in the chest.

491
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,170
You were

492
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,550
so regretful about it.

493
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,050
We were drinking,

494
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,510
but we couldn't find you anywhere.

495
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,030
Someone said you

496
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,680
went toward His Highness's tent.

497
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,400
Weiran and I

498
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,310
thought you and Your Highness

499
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,110
had something to discuss,

500
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,640
so we didn't go look for you.

501
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,640
He's lying.

502
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,960
Why would he lie?

503
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,950
When we were arguing,

504
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,870
was His Highness there too?

505
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,860
Of course he was.

506
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,050
That day, you were drunk and

507
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,000
insisted on pursuing

508
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
Feng Suige's troops.

509
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,550
His Highness advised you

510
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,870
not to pursue a fleeing enemy.

511
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,200
But you wouldn't listen.

512
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,120
You said the chance to kill Feng Suige

513
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,320
was once in a lifetime

514
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,680
and couldn't be missed.

515
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,590
You knew I was drunk,

516
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,010
so why didn't you stop me?

517
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,100
Of course we tried to stop you.

518
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,950
But you promised us

519
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,710
you wouldn't act rashly.

520
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,680
But later,

521
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,510
you left the camp without telling us

522
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,510
and went after Feng Suige all alone.

523
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,080
About what happened after that,

524
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,010
nobody knows.

525
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,110
Ning Fei mentioned

526
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,290
that some soldiers

527
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,240
saw me fall off the cliff by accident?

528
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,040
That's right.

529
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,590
We all thought

530
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,150
you had accidentally fallen off the cliff.

531
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,480
But only after seeing you again this time
did we learn

532
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,410
that you were also shot by an arrow.

533
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,220
Yixiao, don't worry.

534
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,090
As soon as you remember

535
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,350
what happened that day

536
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,240
and who shot you with that arrow,

537
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,100
we won't let them get away with it.

538
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,290
Of course.

539
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,790
If I find this person,

540
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,750
I definitely won't spare them either.

541
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,560
Your Highness,

542
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,490
don't you agree?

543
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,410
Certainly.

544
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,830
Let's eat first. The food is getting cold.

545
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,680
His Highness still needs to return to
the inn today

546
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,240
to handle some
important official business.

547
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
What's so important?

548
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,340
Official business is never-ending.

549
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:41,960
It's nothing but

550
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,440
some trivial matters
about the marriage alliance.

551
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,790
What's so urgent about that?

552
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,460
His Highness's health

553
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,660
is what matters most.

554
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,110
Your Highness,

555
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,370
please eat well first.

556
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,530
I'll have Xueying

557
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,830
prepare some medicinal food

558
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,760
to help you recover your strength.

559
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,440
Okay.

560
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,450
Why did you lie to her just now?

561
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,810
I needed to confirm

562
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,690
how much she actually remembers.

563
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,760
Now it seems

564
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
she truly doesn't remember anything.

565
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,100
How many times have I asked you

566
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,760
to stop being so suspicious?

567
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,040
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

568
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,240
This is the last time.

569
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,680
Once confirmed, I won't worry anymore.

570
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,240
From now on, Your Highness
can interact with Yixiao

571
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,770
more naturally and at ease.

572
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,750
Your Highness is already

573
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,960
breathtakingly beautiful.

574
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,050
With these earrings,

575
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,380
it's truly perfection.

576
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,370
I remember

577
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,790
last year, Father gave me a pair of

578
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,850
white jade earrings.

579
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,010
Where are they?

580
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,720
You want to wear the white jade earrings,
Your Highness?

581
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,270
But these ones

582
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,870
were sent by Empress Zhuang.

583
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,090
They're priceless

584
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,240
and better match your wedding attire.

585
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,300
On my wedding day,

586
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,550
I want to wear the ones Father bestowed.

587
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,590
It's not about

588
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,910
how valuable they are,

589
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,830
but about

590
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,640
Father's sentiment behind them.

591
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,480
That's what makes them truly precious.

592
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,520
Your Highness is right.

593
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,050
I'll go get them right away.

594
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,110
Your Highness, I found them.

595
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:03,840
Sister.

596
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,240
How did it go?

597
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,830
What Xiao Weiran and Ning Fei said

598
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,690
doesn't match.

599
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,240
One of them

600
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,660
is lying.

601
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,970
Who do you think it is?

602
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,400
I'll go ask Ning Fei again.

603
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,390
Okay.

604
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,420
Ning Fei.

605
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,860
Yixiao.

606
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,720
How's His Highness doing?

607
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,600
Don't worry.

608
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,270
His Highness took Xueying's medicine

609
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,310
and is much better now.

610
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,040
That's good.

611
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,130
You must be hungry.

612
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,240
Xueying prepared this for you.

613
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,640
I don't know if you'll like it.

614
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,750
From now on, whatever you want to eat,

615
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,680
just ask Xueying to make it for you.

616
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,240
Later,
when the wedding procession arrives,

617
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,510
we should select some generous gifts

618
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,110
to properly thank Miss Ling.

619
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,560
This is good.

620
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,770
By the way, Ning Fei.

621
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,050
There's something I want to ask you.

622
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,310
Please help me recall—

623
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,480
did anything special happen

624
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,270
on the night of the Battle of Pingling?

625
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,360
Anything special?

626
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,240
I really

627
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,720
can't remember anything at all,

628
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,030
so please help me jog my memory.

629
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,030
If you tell me more,

630
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,680
perhaps I might

631
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,880
remember something.

632
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,180
For example,

633
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,720
was there anyone

634
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,550
who saw His Highness in the camp?

635
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,830
But since you ask,

636
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,160
I do remember something.

637
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,030
That night,

638
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,130
there was a merchant who visited the camp,

639
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,390
and I believe he went to see His Highness.

640
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,920
What merchant?

641
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,600
He said he was trading medicinal herbs.

642
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,870
That's right.

643
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,130
For something as trivial as trading herbs,

644
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,960
why would His Highness need to
handle it personally?

645
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,790
Couldn't Weiran have taken care of it?

646
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,740
I remember

647
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,960
that merchant's carriage

648
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,290
looked quite luxurious.

649
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,830
His status must have been significant.

650
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,830
I didn't think much about it though.

651
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,530
Ning Fei, come have a drink!

652
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,230
Coming!

653
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,490
How many people were there?

654
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,450
I remember there was just one.

655
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,790
I never saw them anyway.

656
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,720
What's wrong?

657
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,270
Are you thinking...

658
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,800
I'm not thinking anything.

659
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,070
I just hope you can

660
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,520
tell me more details

661
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,850
so I can remember everything sooner.

662
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,240
I really want to return to

663
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,270
being the old Yixiao,

664
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,810
able to help you and His Highness more.

665
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,140
Wouldn't that be great?

666
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,750
I thought there was something wrong

667
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,880
with that merchant.

668
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,570
What could be wrong with a merchant?

669
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,670
I was just asking.

670
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,210
By the way,

671
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,020
don't tell anyone about this,

672
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,200
especially His Highness and Weiran.

673
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,130
I don't want them to worry about me.

674
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,230
Got it.

675
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,070
Why would Xiao Weiran

676
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,440
help Xia Jingshi lie?

677
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,660
Could he be involved too?

678
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,020
Were the assassins
at the bottom of the cliff

679
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,290
sent by him?

680
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,300
Who was that merchant really?

681
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,550
What were he and Xia Jingshi

682
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,680
plotting together?

683
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,070
Whatever it was,

684
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,590
perhaps

685
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,270
that was the real reason why

686
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,270
Xia Jingshi shot me with an arrow

687
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,130
and sent me falling off the cliff.

688
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,430
Were you waiting for me?

689
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,770
Since we met,

690
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,390
we've never had time to be alone together.

691
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,200
There are some things I don't know

692
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,730
whether I should say or not.

693
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,580
Go ahead.

694
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,390
We're not strangers.

695
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,680
I want to ask you,

696
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,840
what do you think about
the marriage alliance

697
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,840
between His Highness and Susha's Princess?

698
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,220
Does what I think

699
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,240
matter?

700
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,170
I see.

701
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,090
You must know

702
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,760
His Highness once promised to marry me.

703
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,350
That's right.

704
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,590
There are things His Highness cannot ask

705
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,340
or say,

706
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,030
but I

707
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,490
have to be the bad guy here.

708
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,590
Although right now

709
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,250
you can't remember anything,

710
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,610
someday

711
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,900
you'll remember everything.

712
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,030
Since I lost my memory,

713
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,440
I've met many people.

714
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,270
Whether it's Xueying,

715
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,300
Feng Suige,

716
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,760
His Highness,

717
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,590
or even myself,

718
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
we've always been

719
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,790
looking at things

720
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,230
from our own perspective.

721
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,370
It seems only you

722
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,510
completely consider things

723
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,440
from His Highness's perspective.

724
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,250
I'm simply doing

725
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,900
my duty in my position.

726
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,660
If you were me,

727
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,110
from my perspective,

728
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,440
what would you think about

729
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,840
this marriage alliance?

730
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,060
Rather than being entangled,

731
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,830
it's better to forget each other.

732
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,270
If I say

733
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,490
I never had any intention of entanglement,

734
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,690
would you believe me?

735
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,020
Rest assured.

736
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,200
Even if someday

737
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,720
I remember everything,

738
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,770
I will absolutely not have

739
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,830
any entanglement with His Highness.

740
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,480
There's a type of person in this world

741
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,110
who's naturally

742
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,910
as radiant as stars and the moon.

743
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,400
But loving such a person

744
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,260
is too painful.

745
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,890
I'm a lazy person,

746
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,810
too lazy to bring suffering upon myself.

747
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,270
It's good that you're willing to let go.

748
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,490
I'm quite curious—

749
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,900
are you more concerned that

750
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,510
I might entangle myself with His Highness,

751
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,500
or that I might end up

752
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,880
in pain in the future?

753
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,310
I get it.

754
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,380
Actually, you care about both.

755
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,480
Stop frowning all the time.

756
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,190
Everything will pass

757
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,840
eventually.

758
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,670
Nine.

759
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,570
Your Highness, I've missed you so much!

760
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,880
I've missed you too!

761
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,920
I've missed you too, Your Highness.

762
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,920
I think about you all every day, too.

763
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,230
After a while,

764
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,610
let's go home together with Master,

765
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,210
alright?

766
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,350
Sure.

767
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,110
Xia Jingshi.

768
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,100
Why exactly did you want to kill me?

769
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,530
Alright,

770
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,720
go play over there for a while.

771
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,200
Okay.

772
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:29,750
Okay.

773
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:30,930
Let's go.

774
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,370
Xueying asked me to give you this.

775
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,270
Miss Ling didn't ask you

776
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,160
to give me this.

777
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,330
You made this yourself.

778
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,230
You've read the book

779
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,830
I gave you carefully, right?

780
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,310
Before, whenever the poison flared up,

781
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,880
even after taking the antidote,

782
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,790
I would still feel pain

783
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,550
throughout my body for the first two days.

784
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,310
The military doctor said I should carry

785
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,070
this kind of herbal sachet with me.

786
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,330
The herbal scent helps relieve the pain.

787
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,310
Later,

788
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,360
before each poison attack,

789
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,430
you always prepared these for me.

790
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,060
Your Highness.

791
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,710
To be honest,

792
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,390
I once suspected

793
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,120
maybe you were the one
who wanted to kill me.

794
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,160
When you first came to Susha to see me,

795
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,980
I deliberately kept my distance from you.

796
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,650
It was because Xueying told me

797
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,770
that the person who wanted to kill me

798
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,070
must have been someone
closest and most familiar to me.

799
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,720
Others wouldn't have had the opportunity

800
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,960
to shoot me down with an arrow

801
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,040
at such a close range.

802
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,190
Only after reading the book you gave me

803
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,630
in the last few days

804
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,090
did I understand that

805
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,670
you were the last person

806
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,930
I should have suspected, Your Highness.

807
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,820
It's all right.

808
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,700
I know

809
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,490
that you don't understand me now.

810
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,830
You will understand in the future.

811
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,610
Everything I've done

812
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,040
is for our future.

813
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,910
Everything you've done

814
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,200
is for our future?

815
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,590
Then at this very moment,

816
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,370
I'll act on behalf of my future self

817
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,490
and stop you!

818
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,670
Yixiao,

819
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,680
I hope you never remember

820
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,240
everything that happened that day.

821
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,070
Let all that pain

822
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,140
become the past.

823
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,920
From now on,

824
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,720
I will protect you

825
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,610
with my life.

826
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,720
Are you sure
no one has delivered him messages?

827
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
We've been watching everyone

828
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,030
who enters and leaves the pharmacy.

829
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,750
I heard that Prime Minister Zhuang

830
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,160
has recently been gathering support
from senior officials.

831
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,200
He wants to submit

832
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,910
a joint petition at court,

833
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,720
making His Majesty punish you

834
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,750
for your private correspondence

835
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,550
with Jinxiu.

836
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,050
So in my opinion,

837
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,550
Prime Minister Zhuang has not

838
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,880
told Xia Jingshi about this.

839
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,010
Then keep calm

840
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,310
and continue watching.

841
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:53,720
Yes.

842
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,270
However, Your Highness,

843
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,330
hasn't Miss Yixiao

844
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,830
been staying

845
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,760
with Xia Jingshi for a bit too long?

846
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,900
I-I don't mean anything else.

847
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,720
I just wanted to say,

848
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,160
could Miss Yixiao possibly...

849
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,420
Of course she won't!

850
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,530
Kindness must be repaid;
enemies must be avenged a hundredfold—

851
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,720
that's what the Red-Clad General is like.

852
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,960
If an ordinary person suffered

853
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
such injustice,

854
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,640
they would have gone mad

855
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,400
and confronted him with a knife.

856
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
But Fu Yixiao

857
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,510
could swallow

858
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,900
all her hatred whole.

859
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,200
She knows exactly what she needs to do.

860
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,360
Her composure and decisiveness

861
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,640
are probably beyond even
what you guys are capable of.

862
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,270
Only a fool

863
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,300
like Xia Jingshi

864
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,550
would fail to cherish her.

865
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,310
What?

866
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,240
Are you upset that
I said a few good things about her?

867
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,920
Not at all.

868
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,830
I'll just learn from her strengths
to improve my weaknesses.

869
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,830
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

870
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,830
I will be humble

871
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,270
and seek guidance from Miss Yixiao,

872
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,070
striving to impress you

873
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,800
one day as well, Your Highness.

874
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,810
Why is Zhengnian Hall suddenly

875
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,470
filled with so many patients?

876
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,400
I heard

877
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,150
there's a real estate broker

878
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,280
who's been boasting around

879
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,030
that he knows the Young Mistress
of Zhengnian Villa.

880
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,400
These days,

881
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,480
many people have come because of that.

882
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,610
I'll get to work now.

883
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,460
[Zhengnian Hall]

884
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
Miss Yixiao.

885
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,400
Where is His Highness?

886
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,650
Please get in the carriage.

887
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,510
His Highness is not far from here.

888
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,250
What do you want from me?

889
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,950
This tea is a tribute from the South.

890
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,230
The water used for brewing

891
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,170
is plum-blossom snowwater

892
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,750
collected last December,

893
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,870
freshly taken from the ice cellar.

894
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,960
Such fine tea

895
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,430
gulped down by you like that

896
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,090
is truly a waste of treasure.

897
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,970
What do you want to ask?

898
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,210
Yesterday,

899
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,510
did you learn anything?

900
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:47,960
No.

901
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
You spent a whole night

902
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,630
with Xia Jingshi.

903
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
How could you have learned nothing?

904
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,750
What nonsense are you talking about?

905
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,910
Right, you didn't spend
the night together.

906
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,230
You merely spent one night

907
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,650
under the same roof.

908
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,080
Yet you learned nothing?

909
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,630
Were you simply

910
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,500
lost in pleasure?

911
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,920
When did you know?

912
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,110
What?

913
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,530
When did you know

914
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
that Xia Jingshi was the one who shot me?

915
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,360
Your previous efforts to stop me

916
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,690
were probably for this reason too, right?

917
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,790
So you already know.

918
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,170
Don't worry.

919
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,000
I didn't learn it much earlier than you.

920
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,480
I just never had the chance

921
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,360
to tell you.

922
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,130
I have no reason to hide this from you.

923
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,700
I'd prefer you knew sooner

924
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,260
so I could enjoy watching your reaction.

925
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,190
You really are

926
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,800
incapable of saying anything nice.

927
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,690
Tell me,

928
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,670
since you were

929
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,480
Xia Jingshi's most trusted general

930
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,480
and a hero in the Battle of Pingling,

931
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,200
why did he want to kill you?

932
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,040
I didn't expect you
to care so much about me.

933
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,340
I'd like to know too.

934
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,190
Why don't you ask him yourself?

935
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,400
I'm guessing you discovered something,

936
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,480
something you weren't supposed to know.

937
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,090
He must have been forced

938
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,700
to take such drastic action against you.

939
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,190
Since you're a partner

940
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,440
I can trust,

941
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,240
I might as well tell you.

942
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,590
The day before Susha attacked

943
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,890
Pingling City,

944
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,510
Xia Jingshi suddenly changed

945
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,440
his battle plan.

946
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,990
Before changing the plan,

947
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,950
he received a secret military report.

948
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,400
Didn't you say before

949
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,720
that someone in Susha
was colluding with the enemy?

950
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,510
It must've been around that time.

951
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,280
Very well.

952
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,710
I'll go investigate the military report.

953
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,290
The night the Battle of Pingling ended,

954
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,150
a merchant

955
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,960
met with Xia Jingshi in his tent.

956
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,030
I should have been

957
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,090
in the tent as well.

958
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,150
However,

959
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,880
as for what they discussed,

960
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,940
I cannot remember.

961
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,330
But I suspect

962
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,840
that what that merchant discussed

963
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,770
with Xia Jingshi

964
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,240
was exactly the reason
he wanted to kill me.

965
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,820
Don't look at me like that.

966
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,170
I'm not hiding anything from you.

967
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,030
I truly don't remember

968
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,090
who that person was

969
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,900
or what they discussed.

970
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,040
I'm staying by Xia Jingshi's side

971
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,550
just to uncover the truth.

972
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,900
As you know,

973
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,790
forcing a confession won't work.

974
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,590
And Xia Jingshi

975
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,880
definitely won't say anything.

976
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,540
So,

977
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,110
this might be our

978
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,150
only chance.

979
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,010
Stay safe.

980
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,000
I'll have people protect you from afar.

981
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,400
That won't be necessary.

982
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,750
I'm telling you all this

983
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,230
because I want you to know that

984
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,850
since I've agreed to cooperate with you,

985
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,360
I absolutely won't go back on my word.

986
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,070
Whatever I should do,

987
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,320
I'll definitely see it through.

988
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,800
As for you...

989
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,660
I'll also do what needs to be done.

990
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,690
That's good.

991
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,670
I can't stay out too long.

992
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,110
Xia Jingshi will get suspicious.

993
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:20,650
Wait.

994
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,800
Take this with you.

995
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,290
What's this?

996
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,740
It's my heart of mercy.

997
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,040
Yun Fang!

998
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,580
Escort her back.

999
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,400
No need.

1000
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,430
For safety's sake,

1001
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,080
for the next few days,

1002
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,810
you'd better not come to see me.

1003
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,280
Your Highness.

1004
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,410
Why do I feel

1005
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,120
you care quite a lot about

1006
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,180
Miss Yixiao?

1007
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,110
I care about her?

1008
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,730
So what if I care about her?

1009
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,280
She's a member of my household.

1010
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,810
Shouldn't I care about her?

1011
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:13,830
Your Highness,

1012
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,410
His Majesty summons you.

1013
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,060
Miss. Miss.

1014
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,960
What's wrong?
Where are you feeling unwell?

1015
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,220
My throat hurts badly.

1016
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,750
[Zhengnian Hall]

1017
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,740
Take it easy.

1018
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,210
This way, this way.

1019
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,420
Your Highness.

1020
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,810
The carriage sent by the inn has arrived.

1021
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,740
Where is Yixiao?

1022
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,700
I only heard someone was looking for her.

1023
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,960
In Yujing City,

1024
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,070
she has no family or friends.

1025
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,470
Who would want to see her?

1026
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,700
Your Highness.

1027
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,480
There're many patients
at the clinic today,

1028
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,880
and we're really short-staffed,

1029
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,090
so I sent Yixiao to the medicine merchant

1030
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,550
to fetch some herbs for me.

1031
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,430
Then please, Miss Ling,

1032
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,160
tell Yixiao when she comes back

1033
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,080
to take good care of herself.

1034
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,490
Thank you for taking care of me

1035
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,220
these past few days, Miss Ling.

1036
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,210
Your Highness is too kind.

1037
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,140
It's simply my duty as a physician.

1038
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,460
I'll take my leave now.

1039
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,870
His Majesty has arrived!

1040
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,710
Greetings, Your Majesty!

1041
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,440
You may rise.

1042
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,670
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1043
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,470
Censor Wang.

1044
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

1045
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,440
In your Censorate,

1046
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,170
excluding those on official leave, sick,

1047
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,030
or in mourning,

1048
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,130
how many people remain in the office?

1049
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,340
Your Majesty.

1050
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,690
The Censorate

1051
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,140
has 12 officials of fifth rank or higher.

1052
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,480
Excluding two
who cannot perform their duties,

1053
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,060
there are 10 working daily.

1054
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,930
10 people, huh?

1055
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,640
Do you know

1056
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,440
how many memorials I've received

1057
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,550
in just a few hours?

1058
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,660
18!

1059
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,510
10 people from the Censorate

1060
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,630
submitted 18 memorials to me.

1061
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Is your Censorate

1062
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,160
so idle that you have nothing else to do?

1063
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,980
Stop exchanging glances!

1064
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,110
Since you cannot answer, Censor Wang,

1065
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,630
I presume Prime Minister Zhuang,

1066
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,290
you can explain this clearly?

1067
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,710
Your Majesty,

1068
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,960
I've heard something about this matter.

1069
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,480
It was all because the First Prince

1070
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,280
privately wrote a letter
to the Emperor of Jinxiu.

1071
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,550
This action is absurdly inappropriate

1072
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,600
and unbecoming of a prince.

1073
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,550
The court officials are indignant

1074
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,550
and have submitted numerous memorials

1075
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,320
impeaching the First Prince.

1076
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,110
His Highness the First Prince has arrived!

1077
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,150
I

1078
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,280
pay my respects to Your Majesty.

1079
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,360
Rise.

1080
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,970
I summoned you here

1081
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,520
so you could hear for yourself

1082
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,630
how these people

1083
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,030
are impeaching you.

1084
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,120
Your Majesty.

1085
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,290
As Your Majesty's eldest son,

1086
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,000
the First Prince should
set an example for all officials.

1087
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,330
Such rash actions

1088
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,920
offend royal dignity.

1089
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,960
This matter must be strictly investigated
and punished;

1090
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,190
otherwise, the people will not accept it,

1091
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,040
nor will us court officials.
