00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,320
There are Imperial Guards behind us!

383
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,180
Looks like they're coming for us!

384
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,130
Qiongqi Unit,

385
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,440
follow me back!

386
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,250
I'll help!

387
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,600
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

388
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,640
Lu Ke!

389
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,420
Hurry!

390
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
Stop them!

391
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,010
There are pursuers!

392
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,860
This is bad.

393
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,000
There are too many pursuers.

394
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,920
Gu Yu and Hound

395
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,380
can't hold them off at all!

396
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,310
Guys,

397
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,350
follow me back to cover the retreat!

398
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,350
-Yes, sir!
-Lu Ke!

399
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,240
Protect His Highness and go!

400
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,160
Let's go!

401
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,120
Move aside!

402
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,240
Hound!

403
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,660
Don't waste time on them!

404
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,860
Follow me in pursuit!

405
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,510
Murong Jie!

406
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,800
Honor heaven above,

407
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,750
respect the earth below!

408
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,750
Be loyal to the ruler and the kingdom,

409
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,210
and never fail the people!

410
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,200
Stop...

411
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,960
Stop...

412
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,880
Your Highness...

413
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,640
Hound!

414
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,510
Gu Yu!

415
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,350
Brother!

416
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,720
Kill them all!

417
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,720
-Kill them!
-Kill them!

418
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,750
Brother!

419
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,240
Leave me be.

420
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,480
Brother.

421
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,800
General,

422
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,440
we couldn't catch up to that carriage.

423
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,270
We lost them.

424
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,530
I know you're worried

425
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,330
about your father's condition.

426
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,650
If you really want to return to Susha,

427
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,830
I can help you.

428
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,270
When I was taken away

429
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:36,790
like a criminal,

430
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,830
you did nothing.

431
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,050
Now you come saying you want to help me?

432
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,400
I'll find a way to make Xia Jingyan

433
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,290
let you go back.

434
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,000
Even if...

435
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,040
I have to bow my head and beg him.

436
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,880
For my sake, you're willing

437
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,640
to put aside your pride

438
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,280
and beg your greatest enemy.

439
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,480
Should I be

440
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,140
eternally grateful for that?

441
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,350
I know you resent me,

442
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,030
but we both know

443
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,680
that on your own,

444
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,150
you cannot leave Jinxiu.

445
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,270
No.

446
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,850
I don't resent you.

447
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,590
You can only resent someone
you care about.

448
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,350
I no longer feel

449
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,350
anything for you.

450
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,840
So how could I resent you?

451
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,360
If that's the case...

452
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,280
then I'll return your freedom.

453
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,410
[Letter of Divorce]

454
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,750
All this talk about letting me go

455
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,150
or returning my freedom—

456
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,340
you think I don't understand?

457
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,160
You're just trying

458
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,110
to use this chance

459
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,680
to pay me back

460
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,110
for helping you escape Susha.

461
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,720
So you can feel better about yourself,

462
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,320
thinking you owe me nothing.

463
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,200
How can there be a person as hypocritical

464
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,480
and heartless as you?

465
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,880
Now that things have come to this,

466
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
what's the point of saying all this?

467
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,240
You and I

468
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,920
were never meant to be.

469
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,680
"Never meant to be"?

470
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,400
When you were trapped in Susha,

471
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,730
why didn't you say that?

472
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,240
When you had nowhere to turn,

473
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,570
why didn't you say that?

474
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,270
Now that I'm no longer useful to you,

475
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,070
you say we were never meant to be?

476
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,480
Xia Jingshi,

477
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,550
you disgust me.

478
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,370
I don't need your help.

479
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,960
Stop this pretense.

480
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,830
Xia Jingshi, hear this:

481
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,880
you're merely
a useless prince consort of Susha.

482
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,590
What right do you have

483
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,480
to cast me aside with a letter of divorce?

484
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,940
It is I, Feng Xiyang,
who will cast you aside!

485
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,070
From today on,

486
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,810
we have nothing to do with each other.

487
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,530
Our bond as husband and wife

488
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,120
is severed once and for all!

489
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,710
Then, Princess, as you wish.

490
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,240
From this moment on,
we have no connection whatsoever.

491
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,640
From now on, whatever I do

492
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,250
is none of your concern.

493
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Princess Xiyang,

494
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,310
farewell.

495
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,110
Stop.

496
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,710
I know you hold a grudge

497
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,840
against my brother.

498
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,670
I don't care what else you do.

499
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,210
But remember this:

500
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,250
if you dare to harm my brother,

501
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,690
I'll kill you with my own hands.

502
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,690
What did you say?

503
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,440
The body's gone?

504
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,480
Yes.

505
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,230
I was worried, so I went to check myself.

506
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,830
The body has been taken away.

507
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,530
Father,

508
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,730
could Feng Suige

509
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,670
still be alive?

510
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,480
Jie,

511
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,880
how did it go?

512
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,230
Jie...

513
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,910
Uncle,

514
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,440
please forgive my incompetence.

515
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,610
I failed to kill all of Feng Suige's

516
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,500
subordinates.

517
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,280
They fought desperately

518
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,940
and escorted a carriage away.

519
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,350
A carriage?

520
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,100
Where did they flee to?

521
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,720
To the Susha border.

522
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,400
However, there are
many intersections there.

523
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,440
Based on the wheel tracks alone,

524
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,000
we can't tell

525
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,130
which way they fled.

526
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
However, I've already

527
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,360
sent men to pursue them
along different routes.

528
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,070
Well done.

529
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,690
Jie,

530
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
you should go back

531
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,110
and rest now.

532
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,920
Feng Suige

533
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,440
has to be in that carriage.

534
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,670
But if

535
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,110
it were just his corpse,

536
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,800
there'd be no need for them

537
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,930
to fight so desperately to protect it.

538
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,380
Could...

539
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,600
Feng Suige truly still be alive?

540
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,400
Whether he lives or dies,

541
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,710
his defeat is sealed.

542
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,230
Even if he still draws breath,

543
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,110
he must be severely injured.

544
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,280
Before long,

545
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,510
Feng Chengyang will ascend the throne.

546
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,360
By then,

547
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,710
it will be a done deal.

548
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,280
In this game,

549
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Feng Suige has already lost.

550
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,110
Father,

551
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,030
I was incompetent.

552
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,290
If Feng Suige truly is still alive,

553
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,880
I'll kill him with my own hands!

554
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:25,880
Yao.

555
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,850
No matter what,

556
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,290
you must remember this:

557
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,700
publicly, we must claim

558
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,960
that Feng Suige is dead

559
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,670
and that you

560
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,360
personally executed him.

561
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,070
This way,

562
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,960
when Feng Chengyang ascends the throne,

563
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,020
you'll receive the greatest credit.

564
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
By then,

565
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,320
once we control the situation,

566
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,490
even if there are unexpected changes,

567
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,830
they won't be cause for concern.

568
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,140
I understand, Father.

569
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,230
Alright.

570
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,520
You should go back and rest as well.

571
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,230
Let me think about

572
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,810
how to inform the Empress Dowager.

573
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,350
Your Majesty,

574
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,030
over the past few days,
the Prince of Zhennan

575
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,360
has either remained in Rongyang Palace

576
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,550
or wandered around the grounds.

577
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,590
He hasn't done anything suspicious.

578
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,510
Over these past few days, I

579
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,510
deliberately removed the guards
from Rongyang Palace,

580
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,400
hoping he would reveal
his true intentions.

581
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,030
But he's made no move at all.

582
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,840
Why do you think that is?

583
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
This servant is too foolish

584
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,560
to fathom the reason.

585
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,920
Tell me...

586
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,600
could Xia Jingshi

587
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,710
have planted moles

588
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,150
around me?

589
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,350
Your Majesty,

590
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,710
shall I investigate?

591
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,630
Everyone around me

592
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,230
has been thoroughly vetted.

593
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,630
Xia Jingshi's reach

594
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,890
can't extend that far.

595
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,870
Is it possible

596
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,960
that Xia Jingshi has guessed

597
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,150
Your Majesty's intentions?

598
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,150
That is possible.

599
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,070
But what if he has?

600
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,420
I'll kill him sooner or later.

601
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,230
Your Majesty,

602
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,560
urgent news from Susha!

603
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,410
Susha's Prime Minister Zhuang Shen
has died.

604
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,550
The First Prince Feng Suige...

605
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,620
committed regicide to usurp the throne?

606
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,330
Feng Pingcheng is dead.

607
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,590
Feng Suige was executed?

608
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,200
Your Majesty.

609
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,510
It's destiny.

610
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,260
I truly am blessed by heaven.

611
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,000
I was just thinking about

612
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,660
how to eliminate Xia Jingshi.

613
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,330
And heaven has given me this opportunity.

614
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,360
The Empress Dowager has arrived!

615
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,710
All of you, leave.

616
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,380
Mother.

617
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,920
Mother, you've heard, haven't you?

618
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,590
Feng Pingcheng and Feng Suige
are both dead.

619
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,050
What a pleasant surprise!

620
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,420
The one who will
succeed to the throne in Susha

621
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,920
can only be the Second Prince,
Feng Chengyang.

622
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,760
A young ruler will bring
uncertainty to the nation.

623
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,710
Prime Minister Zhuang is also dead.

624
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,880
Susha's court will surely be in chaos.

625
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,820
In that case,

626
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,110
Susha will be too preoccupied
with its own affairs.

627
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,630
Perhaps for the next 10 or even 20 years,

628
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,190
they won't dare

629
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,760
wage war against our Jinxiu again.

630
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,620
Right, Mother?

631
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,320
What are you trying to say?

632
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,880
Then...

633
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,900
Then does that mean

634
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,480
we no longer need to

635
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,230
keep Xia Jingshi alive?

636
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,110
I'm warning you,

637
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,150
don't act rashly.

638
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,550
Why?

639
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,280
You said it yourself!

640
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,000
You said we needed to spare his life

641
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
to make use of him!

642
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,190
He's of no use now,

643
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,490
so why can't I kill him?

644
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,670
Why can't I kill him?

645
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,360
Whether Xia Jingshi has value

646
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,590
is not determined by Susha.

647
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,840
It's determined by you!

648
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,300
As the ruler of a nation,

649
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,070
how can you be so foolish?

650
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:10,800
In the end,

651
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,840
you just can't bear to kill him.

652
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,670
Don't treat court politics

653
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,630
as child's play!

654
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,570
Xia Jingshi's value isn't

655
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,440
just in helping us against Susha.

656
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,670
The Zhennan Army under his command

657
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,110
is his greatest value!

658
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,470
Without my order,

659
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,880
do not move against him.

660
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,060
Do you understand?

661
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,300
[Edict of Condemnation]

662
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,480
The criminal Feng Suige

663
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,070
committed patricide and regicide.

664
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,230
Such heinous crimes against all order

665
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,840
are condemned by both gods and men!

666
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,250
Now, struck by heaven's wrath,

667
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,450
he has been executed,

668
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,440
his body left to rot in the wilderness!

669
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,470
By imperial decree:

670
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,800
strip him of all titles,

671
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,940
and remove his name from
the imperial family records as a traitor!

672
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,690
All his family assets
shall be confiscated.

673
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,480
His household servants shall be exiled
for military service,

674
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,010
with no pardon for 30 years!

675
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,930
Lord Ling,

676
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,190
where on earth are you taking us?

677
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:11,960
We've been walking for ages

678
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,920
and haven't seen a soul.

679
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,440
Can the Storm Alliance

680
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,070
really be in these mountains?

681
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,480
Carry him properly
and stop talking nonsense.

682
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,920
Remember, once we enter the alliance,

683
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,960
don't mention the Feng family—

684
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,320
especially not the First Prince!

685
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,030
Why?

686
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,400
Lord Ling,

687
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,070
what exactly is the Storm Alliance?

688
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,730
What kind of people are there?

689
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,440
They're all

690
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,240
refugees and wounded soldiers.

691
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,110
Speaking of which—

692
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,130
before we enter the alliance,

693
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,480
let me give you a warning.

694
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,550
The alliance recognizes
no national boundaries.

695
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,440
It has only four branches: Fishing,
Woodcutting, Farming, and Studying.

696
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,900
Each branch has an elder.

697
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,760
Any matter

698
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,190
is decided

699
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,400
by discussion among the four elders.

700
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,020
So watch what you say,

701
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,550
or they might decide to get rid of us.

702
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,390
Y-Y-You're

703
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,920
making it sound so creepy.

704
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,800
Why does this alliance

705
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,480
make me so uneasy?

706
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,840
-Can we really go there?
-Let me tell you something

707
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,100
even more unsettling.

708
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,960
If you can't remember
what I just told you,

709
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,110
the person you're carrying

710
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,230
may die at any moment.

711
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:55,710
Go!

712
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,800
I'll remember that!
