[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,009
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,500
Your Majesty, here, have one.

4
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,940
Come on, Your Majesty,

5
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,070
try this.

6
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,900
Have some wine too.

7
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,479
Have another one.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,840
I missed it again.

9
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,570
Your Majesty,

10
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,070
I've sent
the Prince of Zhennan and his party

11
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,150
to the Rongyang Palace.

12
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,800
So?

13
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,870
Did they like it?

14
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,680
Here.

15
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,230
Bai Shouzhuo,

16
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,750
I like your honesty.

17
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,430
You don't butter me up

18
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,410
or lie to me.

19
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,470
The prince didn't show much reaction.

20
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,870
But the Princess of Zhennan

21
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,280
didn't seem very pleased.

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,150
The Princess of Zhennan…

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,870
Also,

24
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,360
the wife
of Vice Revenue Minister Huang

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,290
is coming to the palace tomorrow
to visit her sister.

26
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,510
Bai Shouzhuo,

27
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,630
earlier today,

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,710
I saw the dress
that princess from Susha was wearing—

29
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,870
absolutely stunning.

30
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,930
Get one just like it

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,680
and send it to Mrs. Huang.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,400
Yes.

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,960
Also…

34
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,310
Go tell the Prince of Zhennan

35
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,430
that since he's back,

36
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,550
I'll hold a banquet

37
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,190
to welcome him.

38
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,870
Let's…

39
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,650
set it for tonight.

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,290
Don't forget

41
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,930
to tell him to bring
the Princess of Zhennan.

42
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,280
Yes.

43
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,360
Go now.

44
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,590
Do you think what Ling Feng said

45
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,190
is true?

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,320
Is Feng Pingcheng really dying?

47
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,790
A matter this serious

48
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,280
wouldn't be fake.

49
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,000
If the Emperor could die at any moment,

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,530
then fortune is on our side.

51
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,750
But Prime Minister,

52
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,360
you don't seem pleased.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,560
What are you here for?

54
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,880
Be careful. Feng Suige might catch on.

55
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,710
Fu Yixiao has figured out

56
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,570
who I really am.

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,560
But Feng Suige still doesn't know.

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,360
I haven't given Fu Yixiao

59
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,630
any chance to approach him.

60
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,150
Later,

61
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
I'll find a way to keep Feng Suige

62
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,560
in the palace.

63
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,710
You think Fu Yixiao will just
do as you say?

64
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,360
She cares a lot about Feng Suige,

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,190
so she won't risk

66
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,400
calling my bluff.

67
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,190
I've warned her—

68
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,920
if Feng Suige learns the truth,

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,260
I'll kill the Emperor.

70
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,120
Let me remind you:

71
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,900
without my orders,

72
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,010
you must not kill Feng Pingcheng.

73
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,440
The heir to the throne
hasn't been decided.

74
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,100
If Feng Pingcheng dies now,

75
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,460
Feng Suige will be next

76
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,930
in the line of succession.

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,930
You must not act on your own.

78
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,470
We've already removed Hou Jing

79
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,800
from the Ministry of War.

80
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,870
You now control the central court
and all six ministries.

81
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,710
If you kill Feng Pingcheng

82
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,750
and make Feng Chengyang take the throne,

83
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,810
who could stop you?

84
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,130
Now is the best time

85
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,079
to kill Feng Pingcheng!

86
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,190
I'll say it again—

87
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,380
without my order,

88
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,560
you must not kill the Emperor.

89
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,680
I was just joking.

90
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,960
I wouldn't dare act recklessly.

91
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,070
Regicide is a serious crime.

92
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,510
Of course I'll listen to
your instructions.

93
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,480
You can put on an act

94
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
for others,

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,270
but spare me that spoiled

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,800
young marquis attitude.

97
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,800
You can't hide

98
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,930
your true intentions from me.

99
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,720
I'm really making a fool of myself.

100
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,310
I'm nothing compared to you—

101
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,280
a wily old fox

102
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,160
who manages

103
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,040
to pass as a loyal, upright statesman

104
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
and make the whole world believe it.

105
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
That's something

106
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,160
I need to learn from you.

107
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,280
All right.

108
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,290
I'm leaving.

109
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,870
I just hope that once it's all over,

110
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,400
you and I can sit down
and celebrate together.

111
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,000
But do you think by then,

112
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,950
we'll really be able to sit down

113
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,950
and enjoy a drink?

114
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,290
Let me warn you:

115
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,120
the truth will eventually come out.

116
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
I can keep Feng Suige in the dark for now,

117
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,800
but not forever.

118
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,990
If Fu Yixiao tells him the truth,

119
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,830
everything will come to light.

120
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,240
Prime Minister,

121
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,970
think about the consequences.

122
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
Murong Yao

123
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,610
looks like a harmless noble heir,

124
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,550
naive and easy to read,

125
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,240
but in truth,

126
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,880
he's anything but.

127
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,590
[Wutong Mansion]

128
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,280
Actually, he's calculating and meticulous.

129
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,190
His eyes and ears are all over

130
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,590
Feng Suige's residence.

131
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,040
The four ladies

132
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,300
who are always with him

133
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,760
should all be his trusted operatives.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,560
Yes.

135
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,430
Chunhan, Xiachen,

136
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,880
Qiuxi, and Dongxiao—

137
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
the four of them are

138
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,370
Murong Yao's
most trusted subordinates.

139
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,310
The two assassins
who came after me that day

140
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,940
were Chunhan and Qiuxi.

141
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,070
So,

142
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,240
his frequent visits to pleasure houses

143
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,510
and daily debauchery

144
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,430
are all

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,040
deliberate acts

146
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,070
to fool everyone.

147
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,120
Yes.

148
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,440
He's always surrounded

149
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,640
by beautiful girls.

150
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,090
But that's just his disguise.

151
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,560
He's very ambitious,

152
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,870
and he's never

153
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,960
let any woman distract him.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,270
Miss, your beauty is unmatched

155
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,240
and captivating.

156
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,750
May I ask your name?

157
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,410
I feel like we've met before.

158
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,000
It must be that night!

159
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,920
You're the very girl

160
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
I saw in my dreams.

161
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,950
When he first saw me in Yujing,

162
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,430
he was testing me

163
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,390
to see if I recognized

164
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,790
Meng Junran's identity.

165
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,430
Who does he care about the most?

166
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,190
Feng Suige.

167
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,690
He's just pretending.

168
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,240
And…

169
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,620
and Elder Marquis Murong.

170
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,620
Elder Marquis Murong?

171
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,770
Murong Yao is a filial son.

172
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,870
He obeys the Elder Marquis completely

173
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,159
and hates to upset him.

174
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,510
You advised me to leave Yujing before.

175
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,190
But I don't want to give up so easily.

176
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,950
If he can be so cruel,

177
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,750
I'll fight him

178
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
to the bitter end.

179
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,890
You're no match for him.

180
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,920
His methods are ruthless,

181
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,320
and he has so many guards.

182
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,120
I don't want you

183
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,240
to get hurt again.

184
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,650
Don't worry.

185
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,590
I won't act impulsively.

186
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,270
I'll observe patiently

187
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,920
and wait for the right moment.

188
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,040
Then I'll make him

189
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,560
pay the price.

190
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,720
Be very careful.

191
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,120
If you need anything,

192
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,630
come find me at Zhengnian Hall.

193
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,040
If I'm not there, leave a note.

194
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,800
I'll see it.

195
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:23,950
Thank you,

196
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,720
Miss Yixiao.

197
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,680
I didn't know.

198
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,960
He never told me

199
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,020
about his illness.

200
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,659
Chengyang,

201
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,970
go to your father now.

202
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,440
Go stay with him.

203
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,960
Mother,

204
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,200
what about you?

205
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,080
You go first.

206
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,320
I still have a few things to discuss

207
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,650
with your grandfather.

208
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,150
All right.

209
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,840
Mother.

210
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:58,870
Alright.

211
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,910
Go now.

212
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,510
Okay.

213
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,910
He never told me about it.

214
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,440
I didn't know.

215
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,710
I knew nothing at all.

216
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,960
I'm the Empress of Susha,

217
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,320
his wife.

218
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,670
Yet he kept hiding it from me.

219
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,720
What matters most now is

220
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,490
who will take the throne

221
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,720
after His Majesty dies.

222
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,000
After…

223
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,390
after His Majesty dies?

224
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,080
By right,

225
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,090
you are the Empress,

226
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,010
and Chengyang is your son.

227
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,150
But His Majesty still hasn't

228
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,550
named an heir to this day.

229
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,670
I used to think

230
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,460
he just couldn't decide.

231
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,030
But he's been terminally ill

232
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,760
for 15 years.

233
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,420
How could he not make arrangements
for after his death?

234
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,080
There's only one reason

235
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,510
he kept it from you—

236
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,790
the heir he chose

237
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,910
isn't your son.

238
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,360
I didn't know.

239
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,000
He never told me anything.

240
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,210
That's because he doesn't trust you.

241
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,180
Remember this—

242
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,360
I'll make sure Chengyang

243
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
takes the throne.

244
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,420
Things won't be peaceful for a while.

245
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,820
Keep your eyes on Chengyang
and stay sharp.

246
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,390
Now's not the time

247
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,750
to grieve.

250
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,050
What?

251
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,150
Are we under house arrest here?

252
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,180
Can't I go out for a walk?

253
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,200
Palace grounds are off-limits.

254
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,460
No outsiders allowed.

255
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,860
Please go back.

256
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,740
No outsiders allowed?

257
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,960
Not even the Prince of Zhennan?

258
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,020
We've been ordered

259
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,080
to prevent anyone from trespassing

260
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,860
on the palace grounds.

262
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,790
This path marks the boundary.

263
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,050
Please do not cross it.

264
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,000
Got it.

[Rongyang Palace]

266
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,010
Your Highness.

267
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,840
There are guards at the gate.

268
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,420
They say
the palace grounds are off-limits.

269
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,290
Looks like

270
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,330
we're under house arrest here.

271
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,360
They're watching us so closely.

272
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,560
We can't do anything.

273
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
I figured as much.

274
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,950
Someone just came to say

275
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,600
the Emperor is hosting a welcome banquet.

276
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,560
Let's see if an opportunity comes up then.

277
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,390
Xia Jingyan is very hostile toward you.

278
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,030
In my view, this welcome banquet

279
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,870
is a trap.

280
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,600
He wouldn't dare kill me.

281
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,480
He did everything he did

282
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,600
in the Empress Dowager's palace today

283
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,150
just to make

284
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,510
the whole world know

285
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,040
he's not afraid of me.

286
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,840
To make it clear

287
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,150
that my life is in his hands.

288
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,150
I'm afraid by now,

289
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,030
every official in court knows

290
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,750
he threatened me with a knife.

291
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,520
How childish.

292
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,860
Even if he won't kill you,

293
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,840
he'll certainly

294
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,840
humiliate you.

295
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,440
Now that we're in Shengjing,

this kind of thing

297
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,790
is bound to happen.

passed into the afterlife.

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,170
You won't live much longer either.

304
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,030
How satisfying!

Hurry and pull him up.

315
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,050
just sent some servants

316
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,960
to help her settle in.

317
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,330
She's a princess

318
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,260
but is forced

319
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,600
to live in a place
as rundown as Rongyang Palace.

320
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,530
It's hard on her.

321
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,870
It truly is.

322
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,840
The floor needs to be cleaner.

323
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,510
Yes.

324
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,280
Move all these away,

325
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,180
and this.

-Yes.
-Yes.

329
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,520
Put them on that table.

330
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,870
The plants in the courtyard

331
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,330
need to be tended to daily.

335
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,510
I asked them

336
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,670
to wash all those

337
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,240
old curtains.

338
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,320
The old furniture

339
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,000
can't be replaced right away,

340
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,880
so I had it cleaned thoroughly.

341
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,270
With everything in order,

342
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:18,840
I hope it helps

lift your spirits a little.

Your Highness would adapt so quickly.

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,150
You thought I was spoiled

347
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,030
and would complain

348
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,200
when I saw how old and shabby

349
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,530

350
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,070
Your Highness thought the same?

351
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,850
As long as I'm by your side,

352
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,480
no hardship scares me.

353
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,670

359
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,840
-Yes.
-Yes.

360
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,600
You just said you'd fulfill
my wishes for me.

361
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,730
What does that mean?

362
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,280
You're clever, Your Highness.

363
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,040
I believe you already know.

364
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,750
I helped you escape Yujing.

365
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,790
You don't want to be indebted to me,

366
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,510
so you want to help me

367
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,740
fulfill a wish.

368
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,330
If one isn't enough,

369
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,200
you can have three.

370

388
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,550
Brother,

389
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,450
I've learned about

390
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,380
Father's illness.

391
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,300
Even Lord Ling, with all his skills,

392
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,349
can't do anything?

393
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:13,880
Will Father

394
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,160
never wake up again?

395
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,569
Don't worry.

396
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
His Majesty will certainly wake up.

397
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,920
Really?

398
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:24,829
Suige,

399
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,040
when Father wakes up,

400
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,490
we should persuade him

401
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,320
not to

402
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,550
work so hard anymore.

403
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,350
I know,

404
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,560
you don't say it out loud,

405
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,590
but deep down,

406
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,740
you care about Father.

407
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,880
Then why is it

408
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,880
that every time you two meet,

409
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,790
you end up arguing?

410
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,710
There are things you don't understand.

411
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,510
And I hope

412
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,560
you never will.

413
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,660
Maybe I don't understand,

414
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,640
but I just

415
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,110
wish you and Father

416
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,240
could get along.

417
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,880
Now that Xiyang

418
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,070
has left Susha,

419
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,310
Father only has

420
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,570
the two of us by his side.

421
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,720
You've grown up.

422
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,010
Much more sensible now.

423
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,550
Uncle!

424
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:39,960
Uncle!

425
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,160
Uncle.

426
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,110
Uncle.

427
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,350
I'm back.

428
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,230
Forgive me, Uncle.

429
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,710
No loud voices inside the ancestral hall.

430
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,190
Uncle,

431
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,000
as soon as I received your message,

432
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,730
I rushed back as fast as I could.

433
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,480
Just now,

434
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,270
I was so happy to see you

435
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,840
and forgot myself a little.

436
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,550
Please forgive me.

437
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,410
Are you very happy?

438
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,260
In your letter, you said

439
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,920
that old man Feng Pingcheng

440
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,750
is terminally ill.

441
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,050
Of course I'm happy!

442
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,000
Heaven is smiling on us.

443
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,480
No.

444
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,510
It's Brother Jingheng
blessing you from above.

445
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,110
He's helping you from above!

446
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,030
Stupid pig!

447
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,070
Stupid pig!

448
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:50,790
Stupid!

449
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,750
-Stupid!
-Uncle.

450
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,210
Stupid!

451
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,920
Uncle, sorry.

452
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,380
Stupid!

453
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,160
Forgive me.

454
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,960
Stupid!

455
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,720
Uncle,

456
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,440
at least tell me

457
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,690
what I did wrong.

458
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,000
Listen,

459
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,860
Feng Pingcheng has to die,

460
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,500
but he must die by my hand!

461
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,670
I can't wait to tear him to pieces!

462
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,790
I will not allow him

463
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,550
to die of illness!

464
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,510
I won't allow it!

465
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,510
All these years
of grieving my son's death—

466
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,480
I have sworn

467
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
to make him pay a hundredfold,

468
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,990
a thousandfold!

469
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,900
I want him

470
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,730
to watch Feng Suige

471
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,520
die miserably before his eyes.

472
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,730
I want him to kneel at my feet

473
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,010
begging me to spare Feng Suige's life!

474
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,210
All these years,

475
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,240
I've been imagining the day

476
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,350
when Feng Pingcheng, old and grey,

477
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,640
buries his young son.

478
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,560
I want...

479
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
I want to see him living

480
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,000
in hell with my own eyes.

481
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
How could I let him die from illness?

482
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,060
I summoned you back

483
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,080
because I have a task for you.

484
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,110
I await your command, Uncle.

485
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,270
He's been unconscious for five days.

486
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,130
I can't let him die just like this.

487
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,570
You must find a way at any cost

488
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,360
to wake him up.

489
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,970
Even if it means poison,

490
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,130
you must wake him up!

491
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,070
I want him

492
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,270
to be fully conscious

493
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,070
when he sees Feng Suige

494
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,830
suffer and die!

495
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Understood.

[Ancestral Virtue and Familial Merit]

498
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,920
Father.

499
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,870
Why are you back?

500
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,600
Your birthday is in two days.

501
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,750
Of course I had to come back

502
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,810
to celebrate it with you.

503
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,680
I came back secretly

504
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,360
just to surprise you.

505
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,440
You're busy
with military affairs out there,

506
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,590
serving the country.

507
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,450
That already makes me very proud.

508
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,270
You didn't need to go through

509
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,930
all this trouble to come back.

510
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,110
I'm old now

511
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,140
and don't care about birthdays anymore.

512
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,540
You're not old at all.

513
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,070
You're still strong and vigorous.

514
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,110
Your best days are

515
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,060
yet to come.

516
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,710
By the way,

517
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,480
I've prepared a special gift

518
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,880
for your birthday

519
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,800
this time.

520
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,290
You coming home

521
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,620
already makes me happy.

522
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,720
No need to fuss

523
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,320
over gifts.

524
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,920
A gift is necessary.

525
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,040
It's a surprise.

526
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,240
I won't tell you yet.

527
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,750
I'll go check

528
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,550
how the preparations are going.

529
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,000
Prime Minister,

530
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,660
Elder Marquis Murong is here.

531
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,720
So secretive.

532
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,750
If there's something,

533
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,410
you can just send me a message.

534
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,790
Why force an old cripple like me

535
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,160
to come here in person?

536
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,070
If it weren't something huge,

537
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,200
I wouldn't have

538
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,310
disturbed you.

539
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,400
His Majesty is terminally ill.

540
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,600
Are you aware of this?

541
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,250
What did you say?

542
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,350
So even you didn't know.

543
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,330
His Majesty kept everyone in the dark.

544
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,980
I wonder

545
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,840
who he actually trusts.

546
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,650
Terminally ill?

547
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,550
His Majesty has been
unconscious for so long

548
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,680
because he's...

549
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,210
I just found out today,

550
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,640
so I invited you over immediately

551
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,110
to discuss it.

552
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,310
You called me here tonight

553
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,140
surely not just

554
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,060
to tell me about

555
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,930
His Majesty's condition, right?

556
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,980
Back then, we fought for this kingdom

557
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,710
with all our old friends.

558
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,160
We weathered the storms

559
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,170
and rode across battlefields.

560
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,510
Now, among those still alive,

561
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,840
aside from His Majesty,

562
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,650
there are only the two of us left.

563
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,820
Some things

564
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,880
can't be left unspoken forever.

565
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,000
I've heard

566
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,110
that while His Majesty lay ill,

567
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,970
you filled all the key posts

568
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,160
with people

569
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,490
from the Zhuang family.

570
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,510
You know the proposed candidate

571
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,640
for Minister of War—

572
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,380
Liu Qin, Vice Minister of War.

573
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,720
He's not a Zhuang.

574
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,200
But in the end,

575
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,960
he's still your man.

576
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,200
Are you saying

577
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,060
you haven't placed

578
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,270
your own people in the court?

579
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,480
Li Liang at the Court of Judicial Review,

580
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,990
Liu Jin at the Censorate—

581
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,070
aren't they your longtime associates?

582
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,120
And your nephew,

583
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,640
Murong Jie,

584
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
holds a key post in the Jinwu Guards.

585
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,670
You've placed quite a few people yourself.

586
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,890
Zhuang Shen,

587
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,440
you called me here today

588
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,030
for the matter

589
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,430
of naming an heir, right?

590
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,800
Yes.

591
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,440
I just want to hear your opinion.

592
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,360
To hear my opinion?

593
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,030
My opinion doesn't matter at all!

594
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,340
Stop beating around the bush.

595
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,680
Even if

596
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,850
His Majesty and the First Prince

597
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
fall out

598
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,350
completely,

599
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,980
I'll still advise this:

600
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
the heir should be

601
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,930
the eldest legitimate son!

602
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,270
So,

603
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,550
your preferred heir is

604
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,350
the First Prince?

605
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,580
He fought on battlefields for years,

606
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,720
winning one battle after another.

607
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,650
The people of Susha

608
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,250
are all well aware of this.

609
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,550
Who can inherit the throne

610
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,200
depends not on military achievements

611
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,190
but on virtue.

612
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,030
Enough!

613
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,400
You just want your grandson

614
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,960
Feng Chengyang on the throne.

615
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,590
Listen,

616
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
unless you can control the whole court,

617
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,920
as long as

618
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,400
I still draw breath,

619
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,550
I'll never agree!

620
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:18,830
[Zhuang Residence]

621
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,240
Give me a hand.

622
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,250
[Zhuang Residence]

623
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,960
This is the medicine

624
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,510
your father needs to take tonight.

625
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,270
I suggest

626
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,210
you have an imperial physician examine it

627
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,920
so no one will gossip

628
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,160
and accuse me of harming your emperor.

629
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,550
You persuaded Lord Ling

630
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,720
to come back during the day.

631
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,590
Although he's agreed

632
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,960
to continue treating His Majesty,

633
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,790
he's still angry.

634
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,790
Who do you mean?

635
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,510
Me?

636
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,150
I'm still angry?

637
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,960
You think I'd stoop to their level?

638
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,560
Ma Qiming,

639
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,350
I think you're the one who's angry.

640
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,070
You resent me

641
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,550
for revealing Feng Pingcheng's illness.

642
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,790
I know what you're thinking!

643
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,810
I wouldn't dare.

644
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,680
I remember

645
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,070
everything you've done

646
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
for His Majesty

647
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,130
all these years.

648
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,550
I'm grateful to you

649
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,490
for saving His Majesty's life.

650
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,790
Eunuch Ma.

651
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:17,750
Yes.

652
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,370
From now on, if anyone in the palace

653
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,110
dares to speak ill

654
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,240
of Lord Ling again,

655
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,680
just give them 30 strokes of the cane.

656
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,010
If any trouble is caused because of it,

657
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,690
I'll take responsibility.

658
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,510
Yes.

659
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,510
I understand.

660
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,830
Lord Ling.

661
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,350
How is he doing now?

662
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,180
In a day or two at least,

663
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,110
or ten days at most,

664
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,110
he will wake up.

665
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,100
As for how well he'll recover,

666
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,080
that depends on his fate.

667
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,310
Great!

668
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,430
Isn't this my brother,

669
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,850
the Prince of Zhennan?

670
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,810
Greetings, Your Majesty.

671
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,950
Yesterday,

672
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,300
you nearly died by my blade,

673
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,750
and today you still dare
to attend the banquet.

674
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,460
You truly don't fear death.

675
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,640
Your Majesty, please don't go too far.

676
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,370
Even if the Prince of Zhennan
has displeased you,

677
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,070
he's here at your invitation.

678
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,070
Humiliating him like this

679
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,480
is a step too far!

680
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,960
Brother,

681
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,140
your wife is defending you so fiercely.

682
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,680
Are you moved?

683
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,070
You may rise.

684
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,150
Thank you, Your Majesty.

685
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,160
Come.

686
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,890
Brother,

687
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,060
let me introduce you to everyone.

688
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,380
Wang Encheng, Vice Minister of Revenue.

689
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,680
Lu Wang, Minister of Rites.

690
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,800
Shan Huaiqing,
Minister of Imperial Stables.

691
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,350
They're all pillars of the court.

692
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,110
Brother,

693
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,390
you should get to know them well.

694
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,160
Be seated.

695
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,600
You may not know this yet.

696
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,240
My brother now

697
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
holds a new role in addition to being

698
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,700
the Prince of Zhennan.

699
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,750
He's also the live-in son-in-law of Susha.

700
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,680
For lasting peace between our two nations,

701
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,030
Your Majesty agreed to
the Prince of Zhennan staying in Susha.

702
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,410
But the prince has returned on his own.

703
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,240
Doesn't this make Your Majesty

704
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,470
appear to go back on your word?

705
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,750
Leaving Susha

706
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,160
was entirely my decision.

707
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,750
It had nothing to do with His Highness.

708
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,830
If Your Majesty wishes

709
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,490
to punish someone, punish me.

710
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,200
The princess eloped with the prince.

711
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,160
Such a bold act

712
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,660
is truly admirable.

713
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,160
We are deeply impressed.

714
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,310
Enough.

715
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,920
We'll just enjoy ourselves tonight.

716
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,400
Stop talking about that.

717
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,920
I'm in such a great mood today.

718
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,000
Brother,

719
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,610
you must

720
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,500
have a good drink with me tonight.

721
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:43,880
Go.

722
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,550
Serve His Highness properly.

723
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

724
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,160
Please.

725
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,270
You can't even serve wine properly.

726
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,870
Why should I keep you around?

727
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,270
Guards!

728
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,880
Your Majesty, spare me!

729
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,340
Drag her out and beat her to death.

730
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,610
Your Majesty, spare me!

731
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,790
Your Majesty!

732
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,830
Your Majesty!

733
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,720
Your Majesty!

734
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,640
See?

735
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,130
Someone died because of you again.

736
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,480
Go.

737
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,730
Pour wine for His Highness.

738
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,400
Yes.

739
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,480
Your Majesty.

740
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,920
Please let me

741
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,070
serve His Highness.

742
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,070
Lady Zhuang Jingyuan,

743
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,400
virtuous, gentle,

744
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,640
and graceful,

745
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,070
has pleased me greatly.

746
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,000
She is hereby promoted
to fourth-rank Consort Yuan.

747
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,480
End of the decree.

748
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

749
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,179
Congratulations, Consort Yuan.

750
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,590
Come to me.

751
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:26,949
Your Majesty.

752
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,110
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

753
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,440
Her Majesty has given birth to a princess.

754
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,449
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

755
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,800
Wonderful.

756
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,370
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

757
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,670
Now, Your Majesty

758
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,190
has both a son and a daughter.

759
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,989
Yeah, indeed.

760
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,800
Your Majesty.

761
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,800
One day,

762
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,670
I shall also bear

763
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,270
a prince for you, if you wish.

764
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,150
Of course.

765
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,440
Let's go see the Empress.

766
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,290
Greetings, Your Highness.

767
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,650
Her Majesty hasn't eaten her dinner.

768
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,230
She's been sitting there

769
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,230
for several hours

770
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,740
without saying a word.

771
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,170
What are you doing here?

772
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,920
It's so late.

773
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,510
Why are you still up?

774
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,070
Mother,

775
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,460
please take care of yourself.

776
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,810
Don't grieve too much.

777
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:49,700
[Murong Residence]

778
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,560
Elder Marquis, we're home.

779
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,260
Elder Marquis?

780
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,090
Elder Marquis.

781
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,600
Elder Marquis is missing!

782
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,570
What should we do now?

783
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,580
What happened?

784
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,800
How did my father go missing

785
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,860
after one trip out?

786
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,760
I…

787
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,110
I truly know nothing.

788
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,510
It took us over an hour to get back

789
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,760
from Prime Minister Zhuang's mansion.

790
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,030
I checked the carriage when we arrived,

791
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,000
and the Elder Marquis was

792
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,340
already gone.

793
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,630
Think carefully.

794
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,280
Did anything unusual happen on the way?

795
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,210
Aside from a cow blocking the road…

796
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,710
I got down and led it away.

797
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,320
Nothing else happened.

798
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,760
After moving the cow,

799
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,710
did you check whether my father

800
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,110
was still in the carriage?

801
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,090
No.

802
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,240
I didn't hear a sound,

803
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,580
so I thought

804
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,830
he had fallen asleep.

805
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,760
Where did you see the cow?

806
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,800
Past Yudai Bridge,

807
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,330
at the third intersection.

808
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:45,920
Right,

809
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,850
there's a crooked tree by the road.

810
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,590
Search every house

811
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,650
in that area.

812
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,880
Even if we have to turn the Yujing City

813
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,360
upside down,

814
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,290
we must find him!

815
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:57,920
Yes.

816
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,190
Fu Yixiao,

817
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,320
I know it was you.

818
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
When I catch you,

819
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,960
I'll skin you alive

820
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,290
and cut you into pieces!

821
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,360
Who are you?

822
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,230
How dare you

823
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,190
abduct me

824
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,990
right under the Emperor's nose?

825
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,880
No wonder you're

826
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,520
a battle-hardened marquis.

827
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,520
Even in danger,

828
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
you stay calm

829
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,960
and unafraid.

830
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,920
So you know who I am.

831
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,440
It seems you're my enemy,

832
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,530
but I don't recognize you.

833
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,110
I spent decades guarding the borders,

834
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,570
fighting countless wars.

835
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,630
I've made more enemies than I can count.

836
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,150
Which side are you on?

837
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,000
What grudge do you have against me?

838
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,920
Go on, say it.

839
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,880
I'm all ears.

840
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,280
Years stationed in the freezing north

841
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,080
left your legs in bad shape.

842
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,320
And even so,

843
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,800
His Majesty still wouldn't
let you come home

844
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,260
to enjoy your retirement.

845
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,800
Is that why the Murong family

846
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,190
hates His Majesty?

847
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:05,880
That's all?

848
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,280
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

849
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,770
My loyalty to His Majesty

850
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
is as clear as day.

851
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,840
I have never hated His Majesty.

852
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,190
Then why is your son, Murong Yao,

853
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,460
plotting mutiny?

854
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,210
It seems you don't believe me.

855
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,900
I joined the army as a boy

856
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,710
and spent decades on the battlefield.

857
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,550
You have no idea

858
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,400
how many people

859
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,960
have tried to frame me for treason

860
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,150
before His Majesty.

861
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,170
If you're going to slander me,

862
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,590
at least come up with something new.

863
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,510
Yao is plotting mutiny?

864
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,420
Sure, he's always been a handful,

865
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,800
but I've never thought of him

866
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,140
as ambitious.

867
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,710
I actually wish he were different

868
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,670
so he wouldn't

869
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,280
spend every day in debauchery

870
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,340
and waste his life.

871
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,280
You think I haven't tried to pull strings

872
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,480
for him in the army and the court?

873
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,040
He just refused.

874
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,070
He won't even take an official post,

875
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,150
but you're saying he's plotting mutiny?

876
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,190
This is the biggest joke

877
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,480
I've heard all year!

878
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,070
Murong Yao conspired with Jinxiu

879
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,710
to assassinate the First Prince.

880
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,640
Do you know what?

881
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,510
Now I know who you are.

882
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,280
You're that female general from Jinxiu—

883
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,550
one of Suige's people.

884
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,570
A Jinxiu general is accusing Yao

885
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:39,190
of colluding with Jinxiu?

886
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,230
A dissolute playboy

887
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,030
from a noble family

888
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,110
who goes around

889
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,670
with four pretty assassins—

890
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,000
who does he want to kill?

891
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,960
Do you really know

892
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,350
your own son?

893
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,070
Do you know

894
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,280
who he associates with

895
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,360
and who he keeps around him?

896
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,590
You were always away at the border.

897
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,960
Do you really know what he's been doing

898
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,000
here in Yujing?

899
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,440
You call yourself
the most loyal official in the court,

900
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,320
but are you sure your son is

901
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,180
as loyal as you?

902
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,360
If he really was

903
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,070
some playboy

904
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,670
without ambitions like you said,

905
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,550
why did he take the job

906
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,010
with the Imperial Guards?

907
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,790
That was arranged by His Majesty.

908
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,170
You just said yourself

909
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,630
that all his life,

910
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,400
he's never followed orders.

911
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,320
He…

912
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,320
My son…

913
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,910
I just feel sorry for you.

914
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:27,960
Back then, you fought

915
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,940
alongside His Majesty

916
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,200
and ended up with all these injuries.

917
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,360
His Majesty knows this full well,

918
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,550
so why did he still send you to that cold,

919
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,280
barren place in the northwest?

920
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,150
Murong Yao and Feng Suige

921
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,680
are the closest of friends.

922
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,080
But he threatened me,

923
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,320
saying to my face

924
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,510
that if I ever told Feng Suige

925
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,360
his secret,

926
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,690
he'd find a way

927
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,630
to kill Feng Pingcheng,

928
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,630
who's lying in bed in the palace now.

929
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,400
I don't care
if Feng Pingcheng lives or dies.

930
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,180
But I won't allow anyone

931
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,290
to hurt Feng Suige.

932
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,630
Impossible!

933
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,290
Yao would never say something like that.

934
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,960
He and Suige

935
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,910
grew up together like brothers!

936
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,030
He would never commit treason!

937
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,230
No matter what method Murong Yao has

938
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,590
to threaten Feng Pingcheng,

939
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,150
as long as I have control over you,

940
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,030
I'm confident

941
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,680
he won't dare make a move.

942
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,300
Elder Marquis,

943
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,400
I apologize.

944
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,090
Are you feeling unwell?

945
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
-Are you alright?
-Your Highness.

946
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,160
Why did you drink so much?

947
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,670
Could you please go get a towel,
Your Highness?

948
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,600
Wait for me here.

949
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,150
Did you see Wang Encheng

950
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,880
just now?

951
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,320
Yes.

952
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,190
You marked his name

953
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,520
in the Daily Chronicle.

954
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,030
And he looks the part too.

955
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,070
I've long heard about
Xia Jingyan's peculiarities.

956
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:57,960
I just never thought

957
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,550
that what the Daily Chronicle mentioned

958
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,110
about his affairs with officials' wives

959
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,170
was actually true.

960
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,280
That Wang Encheng—

961
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,190
see if you can find a way

962
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,250
to get close to him.

963
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,230
Yes.

964
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:07,710
By the way,

965
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,110
when we went in just now,

966
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,640
was anyone standing guard?

967
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,860
Just two eunuchs stayed in there.

968
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,230
Looks like Xia Jingyan

969
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,160
truly believes you've submitted.

970
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,340
You don't understand him.

971
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,150
Removing the guards
was just his way to test me.
