00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,850
things from my childhood.

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,600
The three of us were orphans,

194
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,730
wandering on the streets
and relying on each other.

195
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,240
Later,

196
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,130
we were taken to the death camp.

197
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
I remember

198
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,100
being locked in a cell.

199
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,800
With no food or water,

200
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,520
I was cold and starving,

201
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,130
utterly desperate.

202
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,110
Weiran and Ning Fei

203
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,170
risked their lives
to steal a roasted sweet potato

204
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,780
and secretly brought it to me.

205
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,240
Yixiao,

206
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,440
I hid it in my clothes,

207
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,510
so no one found it.

208
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,130
It's still warm. Eat it now.

209
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,440
Yes, hurry and eat.

210
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,910
-We're not hungry.
-We're not hungry.

211
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,390
I'm fine.

212
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,870
You eat it.

213
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,050
Eat it now.

214
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:34,790
Eat.

215
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,880
Is it good?

216
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,220
If it's good, eat more.

217
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,210
Without them,

218
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,210
I wouldn't be alive today.

219
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,550
So what?

220
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,430
The past is the past.

221
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,760
People's hearts change easily.

222
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,790
Everything

223
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,900
in the world is constantly changing.

224
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,440
People's hearts are even harder to read.

225
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Once

226
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,390
we were enemies.

227
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,650
And now, we're sitting at the same table.

228
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,390
Can the past

229
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,930
really stay in the past?

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,330
Don't you want revenge?

231
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,630
You couldn't do it yourself,

232
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,290
and you're here to lecture me?

233
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,650
You'll soon see a good show.

234
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,340
Be sure to watch it when it starts.

235
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,280
If you don't dare to face it,

236
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,760
how can you let it go?

237
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,680
Stop looking.

238
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,970
All of you, get out!

239
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,440
Be good and leave.

240
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,510
Shunzi.

241
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,850
How did you know

242
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,440
to go to Zhengnian Villa to find Master?

243
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,210
It was Brother Weiran.

244
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,390
He said Master had been
taken away by bad people,

245
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,480
got injured,

246
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,790
and might be recovering
at Zhengnian Villa.

247
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,440
When?

248
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,440
Right before you left,

249
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,720
Brother Weiran

250
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,120
told me that.

251
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,750
Don't move!

252
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,360
I haven't finished stitching your wound.

253
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,840
You…

254
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,790
-Brother Ning Fei.
-Brother Ning Fei.

255
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,840
Brother Ning Fei!

256
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,720
-Brother Ning Fei.
-You may tear your wound open.

257
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,320
You idiot, do you want to die?

258
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,940
Your Highness,

259
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,080
Ning Fei is here.

260
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,800
Why is he here again?

261
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,300
Your Highness,

262
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,990
what does he want this time?

263
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,750
He's here for Xiao Weiran.

264
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,150
So he's finally figured it out.

265
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,360
He's inside.

266
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,170
Say what you need to say.

267
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,790
Ning Fei?

268
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,300
Why are you here?

269
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,960
How are things outside?

270
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,920
Say something!

271
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,200
Does His Highness

272
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,460
have a message for me?

273
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,110
I haven't seen His Highness.

274
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,500
Feng Suige sent you?

275
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,860
I have some questions for you.

276
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,840
The day Yixiao fell off the cliff,

277
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,570
you said someone witnessed it.

278
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,240
Who was it?

279
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,030
I see.

280
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,270
It was all your plan.

281
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,360
You told me to pull back the patrols…

282
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,490
Ning Fei, shut up!

283
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,790
I'll kill you!

284
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,820
Why?

285
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,550
Why?

286
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,700
Why?

287
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,240
Why did you try to kill Yixiao?

288
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Answer me! Answer me! Answer me!

289
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,030
Answer me!

290
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,790
Ning Fei!

291
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,830
Let me ask you,

292
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,170
if His Highness ordered Yixiao's death,

293
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,760
would you kill her or not?

294
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,670
On one side was Jinxiu's great cause

295
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,320
and a military order.

296
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,620
On the other side was someone
you saw as family.

297
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,500
How would you choose?

298
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,010
As a soldier,

299
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,160
I must serve my country.

300
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,630
As a subordinate,

301
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,870
I must serve my master.

302
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,730
Ning Fei,

303
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,760
I didn't want you to know all this

304
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,630
because I didn't want you to bear

305
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,030
this heart-eating pain.

306
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,030
I failed Yixiao.

307
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,980
I betrayed my principles.

308
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,240
I deserve to go to hell after I die.

309
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,570
That's my retribution!

310
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,350
But you don't know anything.

311
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,220
None of this had anything to do with you!

312
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,320
Yixiao?

313
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,610
Weiran was right.

314
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,130
As subordinates,

315
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,360
we should serve our master.

316
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,760
If it were me,

317
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,060
maybe I'd be torn too.

318
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,960
In that case…

319
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,830
let's stop making things hard

320
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,720
for each other.

321
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,040
We were family once.

322
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,110
The three of us grew up together,

323
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,370
fought side by side,

324
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,770
and protected each other.

325
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,440
That bond was real.

326
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,090
And that's enough.

327
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,440
I forgot to tell you something.

328
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,070
When we were kids,

329
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,750
you always gave me
the precious sweet potatoes.

330
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,680
I actually didn't like them at all.

331
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,880
I only ate them because

332
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

333
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
Now it's perfect.

334
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,450
I'll never have to eat them again.

335
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,850
From this day on,

336
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,480
the Three Heroes of Jinxiu are strangers!

337
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,210
Swords will draw blood,
and all ties are severed!

338
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,960
Yixiao.

339
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,850
No.

340
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,830
The great cause of Jinxiu

341
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,590
has nothing to do

342
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,100
with me anymore!

343
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,920
No matter why Xia Jingshi

344
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,000
wants to kill me,

345
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:18,960
whatever scheme

346
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,120
he's plotting,

347
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,750
I won't let him succeed!

348
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,440
I'll make him pay!

349
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,250
Yixiao, stop!

350
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,600
Don't talk nonsense.

351
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,220
What do you mean by cutting all ties?

352
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,950
With whom are you cutting ties?

353
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,960
Weiran was wrong.

354
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,680
He knows he was wrong.

355
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,740
I apologize to you on his behalf.

356
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,400
Yixiao, don't say things you don't mean.

357
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,460
Yixiao, stop!

358
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,020
His Highness must have forced him.

359
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,440
Weiran always obeys him.

360
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,880
This couldn't have been his choice.

361
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,940
Stop talking!

362
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,040
I understand.

363
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,010
Mistakes have consequences.

364
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,830
A simple apology

365
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,680
isn't enough.

366
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:11,940
How about this?

367
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,940
I'll go stab him

368
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,030
to make it up to you.

369
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,120
Do you think I want this?

370
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,560
I don't want this either.

371
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,130
Forget it, Ning Fei.

372
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,520
It's useless.

373
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,930
We can't go back.

374
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,160
None of us can go back.

375
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,590
He's not the Xiao Weiran

376
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,450
we used to know.

377
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,340
And I'm no longer the Yixiao I was.

378
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,010
How did we end up like this?

379
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,000
What are we gonna do?

380
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,550
Yixiao,

381
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,280
we promised each other a future.

382
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Are you asking me?

383
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,300
I don't know either.

384
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,240
Yixiao.

385
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,350
Ning Fei!

386
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,150
Ning Fei!

387
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,440
What's wrong with you?

388
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,880
Ning Fei!

389
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,070
Ning Fei!

390
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,510
Your Highness,

391
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,400
I recorded

392
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,570
their conversation

393
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,450
word for word

394
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,080
without missing anything.

395
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,790
It basically confirms

396
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,170
[Xiao: Ning Fei, I had my reasons.]

397
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,110
what Miss Yixiao said earlier.

398
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,890
[Ning: What reasons? We adopted]

399
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,610
[those kids with Yixiao.]

400
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,720
After the Battle of Pingling,

401
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,830
Xia Jingshi and people from Susha

402
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,830
were having a secret meeting in camp.

403
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,680
Maybe Miss Yixiao

404
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,750
overheard something

405
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,270
and argued with Xia Jingshi.

406
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,480
But what it was exactly—

407
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
we don't know yet.

408
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,370
As for Xiao Weiran,

409
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,240
do we keep him locked up?

410
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,680
Yes.

411
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,050
Hold him until Xia Jingshi comes for him.

412
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,510
Yes.

413
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,750
By the way, Your Highness,

414
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,590
Ning Fei was badly injured

415
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,050
when fighting Xun Xiang.

416
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,350
He was shaken in prison just now

417
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,080
and fainted.

418
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,030
Miss Yixiao has already taken him

419
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,400
to Young Mistress Ling for treatment.

420
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,610
How is he now?

421
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,970
From what I saw,

422
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,270
his wound is festering.

423
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,600
He seems to be poisoned.

424
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,070
I wonder if Young Mistress Ling is

425
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,070
able to save him.

426
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,820
I need raw Pinellia and Arisaema.

427
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,240
He…

428
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,110
How is he now?

429
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,830
That arrow was poisoned.

430
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,100
It's been left in for too long.

431
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
I'm afraid the poison

432
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,160
has already reached his heart and lungs.

433
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,270
It's not that I'm not skilled enough.

434
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,800
Even if my father were here,

435
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,660
he probably couldn't save him.

436
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,440
Then...

437
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,920
how long does he have?

438
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,900
Two or three days, at most.

439
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,610
Where are you going at this late hour?

440
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,370
Meeting Xia Jingshi now

441
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,510
is hardly a wise move.

442
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,400
I heard Ning Fei is gravely wounded
and dying.

443
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,960
I figured you'd storm off in anger

444
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,360
to confront Xia Jingshi.

445
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,440
I'm not here for anything else today,

446
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,410
just to stop you.

447
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,150
Thanks for your concern.

448
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,100
But I need

449
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,930
to face some things myself.

450
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,640
Have you thought about

451
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,170
what to say when you see him?

452
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,400
Are you sure you can get him to reveal

453
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,030
why he wants you dead?

454
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,070
Or do you think

455
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,830
he'll actually tell you the truth?

456
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,180
Whether he does or not,

457
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,180
I want to hear his explanation.

458
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,640
If it weren't for him,

459
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,480
we Three Heroes of Jinxiu

460
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,030
wouldn't have ended up like this.

461
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,690
I'll settle

462
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
that score with him sooner or later.

463
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,490
You absolutely should.

464
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,000
But if you're thinking of

465
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,720
killing him today to vent your anger,

466
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,850
I have to remind you—

467
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,270
the royal villa is guarded

468
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,870
by Susha's Imperial Guards.

469
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,000
I know.

470
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,350
Even if you're lucky enough to kill him,

471
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,230
you'll lose your own life

472
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,090
in the process.

473
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,070
Is it really worth it?

474
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,030
[Heaven Coffin Shop]

475
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,570
I decide whether it's worth it or not.

476
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,790
Besides,

477
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,110
we don't just do things

478
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,510
because they are worth it.

479
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,390
You're right.

480
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,140
Some things

481
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,110
are worth

482
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,830
going through hell and high water for.

483

[Heaven Coffin Shop]

484
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,980
But if you were going to act on impulse,

485
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,640
you would've done it long ago.

486
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,670
You've swallowed your pride

487
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,790
and endured until now.

488
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,180
Wasn't it all to uncover the truth?

489
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,060
[Heaven Coffin Shop]

490
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,590
Your Highness,

491
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,270
I personally went to Zhengnian Hall.

492
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:08,740
Officer Ning is

493
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,030
indeed badly wounded.

494
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,410
Your Highness,

495
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,530
should we

496
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,730
bring him back?

497
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,930
[Xia Jingshi]

498
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,670
When did the three of them meet?

499
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,200
According to the patrol unit,

500
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,730
it was around noon yesterday.

501
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,550
[Xia Jingshi]

502
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,240
Military Advisor Xiao was locked up

503
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,800
by Feng Suige

504
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,970
in the patrol unit's prison.

505
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,200
[Seal of Xia Jingshi, Prince of Zhennan]

506
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,350
It's surrounded by guards.

507
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,480
Our men can't get in.

508
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,370
Has Yixiao been there?

509
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,160
No.

510
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,300
Take this letter

511
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,240
to Xue Yan.

512
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,060
Tell him

513
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,780
to get Xiao Weiran out

514
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,440
at all costs.

515
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,480
If needed,

516
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,110
he can use the marriage alliance
as leverage.

517
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,640
Yes.

518
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,590
Xia Jingshi only sent someone

519
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,270
to Zhengnian Hall

520
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,470
to ask about Ning Fei.

521
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,480
Other than that,

522
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,140
he hasn't done anything else.

523
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,400
Who would've thought
the Prince of Zhennan

524
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,660
would be so heartless?

525
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,720
Ning Fei has been

526
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,110
through thick and thin with him.

527
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,510
Now that Ning Fei is dying,

528
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,110
he just turns his back on him.

529
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,020
Your Highness,

530
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,880
doesn't he fear

531
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,210
disheartening his men?

532
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,680
I had you leak Ning Fei's condition

533
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,700
to Xia Jingshi

534
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,640
not to see how cold he is

535
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,910
to his subordinates.

536
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,080
Then what's your intention?

537
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,600
If a Jinxiu guard officer

538
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,870
dies in Susha right before the wedding,

539
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,530
regardless of the reason,

540
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,000
it could sabotage

541
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,330
the marriage alliance.

542
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,920
Xia Jingshi

543
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,200
hasn't made a fuss

544
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,560
about Ning Fei,

545
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,720
which means he doesn't want
the alliance ruined either.

546
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,050
So Your Highness thinks

547
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,750
this marriage alliance is
part of his plan?

548
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,310
No.

549
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,160
It wasn't Xia Jingshi

550
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,280
who proposed it.

551
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,010
It was the Emperor of Jinxiu—Xia Jingyan.

552
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,240
At most, Xia Jingshi is using

553
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,900
the marriage for his own ends.

554
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,800
Then what exactly does he want?

555
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,680
Fu Yixiao.

556
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,160
That's why Xia Jingshi came

557
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,220
for this alliance—

558
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,490
to take Fu Yixiao away.

559
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,150
Sister,

560
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,110
stop wiping.

561
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,270
You haven't slept all night.

562
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,420
Go get some rest.

563
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,440
How is he?

564
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,220
I just finished the acupuncture.

565
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,180
Some of the poisoned blood
has been drained.

566
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,790
Will he wake up?

567
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,370
It's already a miracle
that he made it through the night.

568
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,440
There were several times

569
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,170
I couldn't even find his pulse.

570
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,750
Sister,

571
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,830
I'm sorry.

572
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,110
It's all my fault.

573
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,240
My medical skills aren't good enough.

574
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
It's all my fault.

575
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,340
Don't say that.

576
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,370
You've done your best.

577
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,240
It's my fault.

578
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,620
I shouldn't have doubted him.

579
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,110
I should've seen from the start

580
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,110
that this had nothing to do with him.

581
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,280
I never should've dragged him into this.

582
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,410
And I definitely shouldn't have
said those harsh words.

583
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,780
Those who want me dead are Xiao Weiran

584
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,340
and Xia Jingshi.

585
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,390
He's never done

586
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,980
anything wrong.

587
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,530
When he was little, he used to say

588
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,920
he wanted a home.

589
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,590
He said we Three Heroes of Jinxiu

590
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,680
should go somewhere

591
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,140
with mountains and rivers

592
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,930
and have a house to grow old in together.

593
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,710
We'll bask in the sun,

594
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,090
grow some flowers,

595
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,910
and stop fighting and killing.

596
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,810
The house doesn't need to be big—

597
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,040
just a place we can call home.

598
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
I don't know what else I can do

599
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,030
for him now.

600
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,270
With this,

601
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,440
at least he can finally have a home.

602
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,980
[Zhengnian Hall]

603
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,400
Sir.

604
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,060
We're here.

605
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,970
We're here.

606
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,550
[Ling Feng, Master of Zhengnian Villa]

607
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,050
[Zhengnian Hall]

608
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,350
You fool.

609
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,620
Wake up, Ning Fei.

610
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,110
Ning Fei!

611
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,710
Ling Xueying!

612
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:22,830
Father!

613
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,140
Let go of him.

614
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:24,920
Your hands…

615
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,410
Let go.

616
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,040
Let go of him!

617
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,740
What are you doing?

618
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,790
I'm treating him.

619
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,880
Who taught you to treat a patient

620
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,550
while bawling your eyes out like that?

621
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,030
You.

622
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,010
Me?

623
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,760
Give me a break!

624
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,310
Father, save him.

625
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,230
Please help him.

626
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,240
That coffin by the door

627
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,370
is prepared for him?

628
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,480
Well-timed.

629
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,120
We'll be needing it soon.

630
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,030
Father,

631
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,830
please save him.

632
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,200
I'm begging you to save him.

633
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,680
Father.

634
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,970
Save him?

635
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,350
He's already at death's door.

636
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,830
Do you want me to ruin my spotless record?

637
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,560
Come with me.

638
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,310
Father,

639
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,570
what are you doing?

640
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,590
Got any silver on you?

641
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,200
Pay the coachman for me.

642
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:05,830
My medicine box

643
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,400
is still being held as collateral.

644
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,370
Listen to me.

645
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,270
The box is more important than him.

646
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,300
Hurry, let's go.

647
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,840
Father,

648
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,430
what are you doing?

649
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,950
You paid the coachman for me?

650
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

651
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,080
Lord Ling.

652
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,400
I've had people
searching for you all over.

653
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,030
Why has it been

654
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,110
so hard to find you?

655
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,750
A patient asked me
to find some medicine for him.

656
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,010
What do you need me for?

657
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,630
Naturally, I need your help.

658
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,680
I need you to check on a friend's injury.

659
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,920
What kind of friend

660
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,320
deserves such concern
from Your Highness?

661
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,070
She's inside.

662
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,650
Come with me.

663
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,240
Father.

664
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:44,830
Come.

665
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Clench your fist.

666
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,480
Harder.

667
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,730
Alright.

668
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Let me take a look.

669
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,270
Aside from the injury to your hand,

670
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,530
you also have amnesia.

671
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,980
Falling from that height

672
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,440
and not ending up in pieces,

673
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,790
you must've been caught

674
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,030
by branches on the way down.

675
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,350
They slowed your fall.

676
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,680
As for the amnesia,

677
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,340
since it's from a head trauma,

678
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,880
it means there's a clot in your brain.

679
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,730
The clot

680
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,090
is the real problem.

681
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,830
Torn tendons can be reattached.

682
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,270
As for the clot,

683
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,270
with time and treatment,

684
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,130
it can be fixed.

685
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,400
Yixiao,

686
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,240
I told you

687
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,000
my father would definitely heal you.

688
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,600
Thank you.

689
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,630
I have a difficult request.

690
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,340
My injury is not

691
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,230
worth troubling you, Lord Ling.

692
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,270
I only hope you can

693
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,390
save my brother.

694
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,310
Brother?

695
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,300
That dying man on the bed?

696
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,130
Yes.

697
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,270
Haven't you already prepared

698
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,200
a coffin for him?

699
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,340
Better to bury him soon.

700
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,480
Father,

701
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,750
are you seriously going

702
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,400
to just let him die?

703
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,350
I seriously am.

704
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,070
His pulse is shallow, fading fast,

705
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,750
barely there—
just the signs of heart failure.

706
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,350
It won't be long

707
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,640
before he takes his last breath.

708
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,480
I, Ling Feng, only treat

709
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,740
those who can be saved.

710
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,490
I never fight Hades for a soul.

711
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,520
Lord Ling.

712
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Please, save him!

713
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,180
Yixiao, don't do this.

714
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,220
Father,

715
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,380
Yixiao is my sister.

716
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,030
Her brother

717
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,950
is my brother.

718
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,350
Lord Ling, your skills are unmatched.

719
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,640
There must be another way.

720
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,590
If you can save him,

721
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,440
I'll do anything you ask.

722
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,030
Miss,

723
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,770
rules are rules.

724
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,880
No amount of pleading will change that.

725
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,660
Get up.

726
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,400
I won't.

727
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,270
Lord Ling,

728
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,030
your skills

729
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,880
can work miracles,

730
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,720
and you have a kind heart.

731
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,510
Please, I beg you.

732
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,480
You can't just leave him to die.

733
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:27,830
Yixiao.

734
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,400
I can!

735
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,520
Lord Ling!

736
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,400
Yixiao.

737
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,680
Father!

738
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,570
Wait for me, Father.

739
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,240
She's my sister.

740
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,270
You must help her.

741
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,400
Zhengnian Hall.

742
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,640
I-I'm in Yujing now.

743
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,400
I need a place to stay, don't I?

744
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,840
Besides,

745
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,830
Zhengnian Villa

746
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,720
having a branch in Yujing

747
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,220
isn't a bad thing, right?

748
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,290
Such a big house

749
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,310
must be expensive.

750
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,840
Where did you get the money?

751
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,100
I put it on the Emperor of Susha's tab.

752
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,070
You foolish girl!

753
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,730
You've got some nerve!

754
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,510
You're driving me crazy.

755
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,880
Father, where are you going?

756
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,810
Where am I going?

757
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,570
You're such a troublemaker!

758
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,540
I have to run.

759
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,000
With all that debt you racked up,

760
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,590
how am I supposed to pay it back?

761
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,120
Also,

762
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,510
that guy is practically
in his grave already,

763
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,010
and you want me to save him?

764
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,920
Why don't you just bury me

765
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,270
with him and be done with it?

766
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,890
Father!

767
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,320
What do you mean?

768
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,840
Lord Ling,

769
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,300
forgive me.

770
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,360
Your Highness, what's the meaning of this?

771
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,110
That girl even knelt to you.

772
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,060
Helping her

773
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,210
would hardly cost you a thing.

774
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,600
She knelt to me. So what?

775
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,780
I could kneel to her too if needed.

776
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,480
Besides,

777
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,710
am I supposed to help everyone who asks?

778
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,750
Those stupid rules of your Zhengnian Villa

779
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,160
should be changed.

780
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,130
Take Lord Ling to the medical hall.

781
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,560
Lord Ling,

782
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,840
please.

783
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,580
Trying to strong-arm me, huh?

784
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,210
Wanna fight?

785
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,389
Don't make me prick you with needles!

786
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,230
-Father!
-Let go of me!

787
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,590
I'm warning you,
I'll prick you with needles!

788
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,469
Let go!

789
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:24,940
This is my father's

790
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,280
Seven-Aperture Acupuncture.

791
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,139
It can bring the dead back to life.

792
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,659
It looks simple,

793
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,230
but every twist

794
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:31,760
and insertion

795
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,159
requires precise skill.

796
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,440
Since my father

797
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,790
agreed to save Ning Fei,

798
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,760
he's definitely not going to die.

799
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,520
Didn't Lord Ling just say

800
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,120
this man couldn't be saved?

801
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,480
Did I say he'd survive?

802
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,710
I've only temporarily sealed

803
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,710
his heart meridian

804
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,639
to control the poison in his blood.

805
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,320
To put it plainly,

806
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,179
I'm just buying him two more days.

807
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,840
That's impossible.

808
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,000
Nothing is impossible.

809
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,290
I don't do miracles.

810
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,550
When I say he can't be saved,

811
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,580
he can't be saved.

812
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,969
Would I lie about that?

813
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
If he can't be saved,

814
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,440
why make him live two more days?

815
00:34:59,440 --> 00:34:59,980
Just because I can't

816
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,580
save him doesn't mean no one…

817
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,210
can save him.

818
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,890
Who can save him?

819
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,840
There is a place where they have

820
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,040
a secret blood replacement technique.

821
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,620
It might save his life.

822
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,660
Where is that place?

823
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,550
It's located outside the borders

824
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,960
of Susha and Jinxiu.

825
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,930
Ordinary people can't even

826
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,670
hear of this secret place,

827
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,660
let alone get in.

828
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,500
They have a rule—

829
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,400
anyone who enters

830
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,060
must become one of them

831
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,520
and swear a blood oath

832
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,570
to never betray them or escape.

833
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,550
Father,

834
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,990
how do you know about this place?

835
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,510
I once saved one of those people

836
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,550
in the woods.

837
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,490
That's how I knew their secret.

838
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,440
Miss,

839
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,610
are you sure about this?

840
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,440
If you send your brother there,

841
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,610
even if he's saved,

842
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,700
he'll likely never be free again.

843
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,280
I'm sure.

844
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,840
Being alive is more important
than anything.

845
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,400
I agree.

846
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,110
I agree to any condition.

847
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,640
Alright.

848
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,150
Does he have any blood relatives?

849
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,880
The contract

850
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,630
requires a handprint
from a close relative.

851
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,490
He's an orphan.

852
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,220
I'm the only family he has.

853
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,140
That's a problem.

854
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,410
What's the problem?

855
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
It's just a handprint.

856
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,080
I'll do it.

857
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,280
If you put your handprint,

858
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,030
you'll be

859
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,150
the guarantor.

860
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,760
Their rules are strict.

861
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,590
What they say goes.

862
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,670
If your brother escapes,

863
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,030
you'll need to bring him back.

864
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,210
If you can't,

865
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,110
you'll have to repay

866
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,630
the debt of gratitude in his place.

867
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,430
I understand.

868
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,230
Who's going to draft the contract?

869
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,490
You don't understand.

870
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,760
They are going to save his life.

871
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,760
If he runs,

872
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,320
you'll have to give your life
in his place.

873
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,930
I know.

874
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,360
I'm willing to bear all consequences.

875
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,030
Father,

876
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,800
what kind of place is that?

877
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,480
Why does it have

878
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,840
even more rules than our Zhengnian Villa?

879
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,960
What do you know?

880
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,110
If people there are willing to help,

881
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,630
except for those already claimed by death,

882
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,090
they can save anyone.

883
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,260
Father,

884
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,190
that doesn't sound like you.

885
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,000
In all my life,

886
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,920
I've never seen you admit
someone else is better.

887
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,580
Then you haven't seen enough.

888
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,390
Draft the contract now.

889
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,070
I'm afraid
Ning Fei won't last much longer.

890
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,470
What are you doing?

891
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,990
Making Xia Jingshi and the others

892
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,670
believe that Ning Fei is already dead.

893
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,000
It makes things easier.

894
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,220
Once he leaves this place,

895
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,710
he'll no longer be involved
in worldly conflicts.

896
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,240
Jinxiu and Susha

897
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,590
will have nothing to do with him anymore.

898
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,480
This is probably

899
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,810
the best ending for him.

900
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,180
Thank you.

901
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,670
Miss,

902
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,990
I've taken the contract.

903
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,110
From this day on,

904
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,640
you'll be held accountable

905
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,920
for everything

906
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,890
this man does.

907
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,920
Don't worry.

908
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,240
We're not related by blood,

909
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,880
but we'll be family for life.

910
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,880
As long as he's alive, that's enough.

911
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,410
Alright.

912
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,710
I'll draw you a map in a bit

913
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,000
and show you the location.

914
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,630
Once your people

915
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,630
send him there,

916
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,630
they'll take him

917
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,090
after they see the letter.

918
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,750
Remember—

919
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,030
when your people arrive,

920
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,430
they must be blindfolded

921
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,310
and ask no questions at any time.

922
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,680
Understood.

923
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,350
[Jingming Garden]

924
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,270
Thank you for coming in person,

925
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,570
Minister Shen.

926
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,060
Minister Shen.

927
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,670
I've brought the man.

928
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,630
[Jingming Garden]

929
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,500
On behalf of His Highness,

930
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,800
I thank you.

931
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,860
Your Highness.

932
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,860
Aren't you curious

933
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,440
why Feng Suige let you return?

934
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,990
Susha had promised

935
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,370
to return Yixiao to me.

936
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,830
But I gave that spot to you.

937
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,630
You shouldn't have saved me.

938
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,200
I shouldn't have saved you?

939
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,390
If I hadn't saved you,

940
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,250
should I have just let you die?

941
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,150
Better I kill you myself

942
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,140
than let Feng Suige do it!

943
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,340
What did you do wrong?

944
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,890
I failed to kill Yixiao.

945
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,250
Do you have a death wish?

946
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,140
Your Highness,

947
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,690
Yixiao cannot be spared.

948
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,630
She's forgotten everything.

949
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,280
She was about

950
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,320
to come back to me.

951
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,220
Why did you act on your own?

952
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,030
Why did you ruin everything?

953
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,010
She already knows

954
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,650
you were the one
who shot her off the cliff.

955
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,040
She also knows

956
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,110
I sent assassins after her.

957
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,360
You know better than anyone

958
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,620
how capable Yixiao is.

959
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,140
If she lives,

960
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,280
she'll be a threat to you.

961
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,070
You're in no position

962
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,470
to make decisions for me.

963
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,970
Your Highness.

964
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,630
I just couldn't bear

965
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,190
to see you backed into a corner again.

966
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,030
Everything I've done

967
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,230
was all for you!

968
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,460
You resent me.

969
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,260
I don't dare.

970
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,450
You resent me for going back on my word.

971
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,090
You resent me
for failing to protect Yixiao.

972
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,580
Yixiao is your family.

973
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,170
How could you bring yourself to kill her?

974
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,480
It's all my fault

975
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,180
that you ended up like this.

976
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,020
No!

977
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,590
When we chose to follow you,

978
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,520
we swore an oath.

979
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,280
Our lives

980
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,190
belong to you.

981
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,020
Leave now.

982
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,320
You've been exposed.

983
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,510
Feng Suige will definitely have people

984
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,960
watching you.

985
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,070
Go to the border now

986
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,430
and gather men.

987
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,460
Once I find a way to escape,

988
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,550
you'll be there waiting.

989
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:46,760
Yes.

990
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,610
[In Memory of Late Mother Qingyu]

991
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,250
Where exactly are you

992
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,250
sending Ning Fei?

993
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,250
Don't ask too much.

994
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,360
When it's time for you to know,

995
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,230
you'll know.

996
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,020
[In Memory of Late Mother Qingyu]

997
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,210
Does it have something to do

998
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,370
with my mother?

999
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,730
I said don't ask.

1000
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,050
What's that girl to you?

1001
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,030
She's Fu Yixiao,
the Red-Clad General of Jinxiu,

1002
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,160
who nearly killed me

1003
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,480
with an arrow at the Battle of Pingling.

1004
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
An enemy?

1005
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,990
She used to be.

1006
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,800
And now?
