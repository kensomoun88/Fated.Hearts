00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,200
You did nothing wrong.

195
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,030
Don't torment yourself

196
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,760
with other people's mistakes.

197
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,950
But...

198
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,640
Why didn't you let me die?

199
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,790
If I had died, everything would be over.

200
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,390
If I had died,

201
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,190
I wouldn't have to face all this.

202
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,790
My brother who once fought beside me

203
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,920
has become my enemy.

204
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,080
The prince I trusted most

205
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,410
deceived me so cruelly.

206
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,000
I… I don't know

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,480
what meaning my life still has.

208
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,960
I risked everything to save you,

209
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,290
and you just want to die?

210
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,720
If you value your life so little,

211
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
why did I save you in the first place?

212
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,120
Listen to me.

213
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,600
Nothing is

214
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,720
more important than staying alive.

215
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Even if it's for my sake,

216
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,870
you must live well!

217
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,120
But if only I had found out sooner

218
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,240
what they were really like,

219
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,570
I could have warned you.

220
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,720
You wouldn't have

221
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,980
almost lost your life.

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm just a fool.

223
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,910
What right do I have

224
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,910
to be your brother?

225
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,320
I don't deserve to be your brother.

226
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,450
Just leave me alone.

227
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,670
Just leave me alone.

228
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,320
Ning Fei.

229
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,790
It's not that serious.

230
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,190
No matter what you think,

231
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
you'll always be my brother.

232
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,600
What?

233
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,440
Don't you want to grow old

234
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,370
with me anymore?

235
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,720
Don't you want

236
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,910
to live a carefree life with me

237
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,570
in a beautiful place anymore?

238
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,030
Ning Fei,

239
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,030
you were the fearless,

240
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,440
battle‑hardened,

241
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,100
number one general of Jinxiu.

242
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,910
I've always known

243
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,320
that nothing

244
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,520
could ever break you.

245
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,020
Listen carefully.

246
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,030
From today on,

247
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,650
you must pull yourself together.

248
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,280
That's more like it.

249
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,440
That's my brother.

250
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,870
That's the Ning Fei I know.

251
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,360
Sister.

252
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,210
Feng Suige is awake.

253
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,510
Feng Suige!

254
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,510
Feng Suige, you're awake.

255
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,200
Thank goodness.

256
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,740
You're finally awake.

257
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,030
Yixiao.

258
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,030
I'm awake.

259
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,750
I'm fine now, Yixiao.

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,060
That's wonderful.

261
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,810
You're finally awake.

262
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,240
They told me everything.

263
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,440
You went all out to save me.

264
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,160
Thank you for everything you did for me.

265
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,310
It's nothing.

266
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,090
How are you feeling?

267
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:39,960
Good.

268
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,630
I'm fine now.

269
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,050
What's wrong with you?

270
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,600
Look at me.

271
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,440
Are you...

272
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,840
are you feeling unwell?

273
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,600
I can't see you now.

274
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,450
What's happening?

275
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,380
It's alright, Yixiao.

276
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,480
What's going on?

277
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,870
You can't see me?

278
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,000
What's going on here?

279
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,240
Yixiao,

280
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,790
don't panic.

281
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,320
I was planning

282
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,360
to tell you later.

283
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,680
After he woke up,

284
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,030
he became blind.

285
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,500
He went without air too long.

286
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,030
Blood clotted in his head

287
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,290
and hasn't dispersed.

288
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,850
To be honest,

289
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,870
although his life was saved,

290
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,870
his eyes

291
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,870
may never recover.

292
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,930
It's okay, Yixiao.

293
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,920
It's alright.

294
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,790
You've done your best

295
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,750
to save my life.

296
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,980
This is already the best outcome.

297
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,270
I'm already very content and happy.

298
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,500
It's okay, Yixiao.

299
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,200
Yixiao.

300
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,040
Don't talk like that.

301
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,200
Since Heaven

302
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,130
let you survive,

303
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,030
you're meant to take back

304
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,480
everything you've lost.

305
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
You'll be fine.

306
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,030
I'll be fine.

307
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,360
I'll recover, Yixiao.

308
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,470
Are you...

309
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,030
Are you crying?

310
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,480
Don't cry, Yixiao.

311
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,720
I'll gradually get used to it.

312
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,910
I'll get better.

313
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,200
What matters most right now

314
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,440
is that you're here with me.

315
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,300
That's enough.

316
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,630
I don't want you to get used to it.

317
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,830
I want you to recover.

318
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,910
I know you two

319
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,960
have already

320
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,290
done so much to save him.

321
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,240
But Feng Suige

322
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,080
really cannot lose his eyesight.

323
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,870
He's already lost too much.

324
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,520
He still has many things to do.

325
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,550
I beg you,

326
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,870
please find a way to help him.

327
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,750
Please find a way to heal his eyes.

328
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,800
Miss Yixiao, may I have a word with you?

329
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,570
I'll be right back.

330
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,080
All right.

331
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,440
I haven't avenged Father yet.

332
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,080
Xiyang is still trapped
in enemy territory.

333
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,740
But now I've become like this.

334
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,590
I can't be a burden to Yixiao any longer.

335
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,110
Some things are hard to say

336
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,370
in front of Feng Suige.

337
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,120
The blood clot in his head is still there.

338
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,840
If it hardens

339
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,360
and blocks his meridians,

340
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,160
even the gods couldn't save him.

341
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,150
In other words,

342
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,960
even though he's awake,

343
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,870
his life is

344
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,800
still in danger.

345
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,200
As physicians, we can only do our best.

346
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,400
We cannot fight fate.

347
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,160
This is not his fate.

348
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,550
Feng Suige's fate

349
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,410
is to live a long and healthy life.

350
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,020
Elder Zhou,

351
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,840
Lord Ling,

352
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,750
you're both renowned physicians.

353
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,870
There must still be a way.

354
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,960
There must still be a way

355
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,020
to save him, right?

356
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,070
I beg you both,

357
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,920
think harder.

358
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,240
You can surely think of a way

359
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,030
to heal him.

360
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,290
I'm begging you.

361
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,080
Please save him.

362
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,750
Lord Ling.

363
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,870
Actually…

364
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,650
there might be a way.

365
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,270
Don't come up with reckless ideas.

366
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,730
Let's ask Lady An for help.

367
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,600
No!

368
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,120
Absolutely not! Definitely not!

369
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,840
Why not?

370
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,790
I can set aside our personal grudges

371
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,870
for now,

372
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,390
but for Suige's sake,
I can't take the risk.

373
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,630
Both of us have run out of options.

374
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,970
Why not turn to Lady An?

375
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,930
Turn to her? How?

376
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,910
Even if she agrees to help,

377
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,960
can you guarantee she'll save him

378
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,390
and not harm him?

379
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,120
I guarantee!

380
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,270
Lord Ling,

381
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,720
do you actually

382
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
have another way,

383
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,320
but just don't want to use it?

384
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,150
N-No, I don't.

385
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:49,960
That's not it.

386
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,420
Then why won't you tell me?

387
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,890
Look at that man.

388
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,140
He's called Huang.

389
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,670
He once fell off a cliff

390
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,910
while hunting

391
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,000
and hit his head. He nearly died.

392
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,440
Even Zhou Hao couldn't save him.

393
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,600
Then Lady An stepped in.

394
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,660
She saved his life,

395
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,360
but he lost

396
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,480
all his memories.

397
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,370
Could we at least ask her

398
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,000
to check on Suige first?

399
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,320
If this is our only option,

400
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,440

I shouldn't have mocked you,

saying you weren't worthy
to be a physician.

431
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,510
I came up the mountain

Tell me—
are the blue mushrooms more poisonous,

439
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,590
or the red ones?

00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,720
will you help me?

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,050
I wasn't talking to you.

444
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,030
Well,

445
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,440
the patient is named Feng Suige.

446
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,010
He's Wei Qingyu's son.

447
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,270
He was harmed by villains

448
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,000
and is dying.

449
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,720

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,580
Is he handsome?

451
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,240
Why are you asking that?

452
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,720
His mother was once

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,110
a famous beauty.

454
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,350
If he isn't handsome,

455
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,350
I'll wonder

456
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,790
if he's actually her son.

What were you just saying? Go on.

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,750
So you two

461
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,480
couldn't cure him completely.

Now you're swallowing your pride
and seeking help everywhere.

463
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,920
Now you admit
I'm more skilled than you, huh?

00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,720

00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,880
By the way, how tall is he?

468
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,110
Six feet tall. Why?

469
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,680

not ugly.

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,310

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,350
if she had studied medicine,

482
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,920
she'd certainly be a peerless physician.

483
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,270
But she's obsessed with poisons

484
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,000

There's just a chance of it.

523

If the clot stays in your head,

524
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,490
you'll not only stay blind;

525

526

counts as memory loss?

You're the First Prince of Susha.

538

You bear great responsibilities.

539

After everything they've done to you,

540
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,070
are you really going to watch

541
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,400

542
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,480
and enjoy their peace?

543
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,210
Would you be content with that?

544
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,270
I know you wouldn't.

545
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,310
So first,

546
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,770
we must restore your sight

547
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,160
and save your life.

548
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,350
Then you'll have the chance

549
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,830
to do what you need to do.

550
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,640
When I found you

551
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,270
and dug you out

552
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,200
from the ground,

553
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,690
I truly thought you were dead.

554
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,790
I've already felt once

555
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,250
what it's like to lose you.

556
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,370
I don't want to go through it again.

557
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,640
Just do it for my sake,

558
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,440
okay?

559
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,160
But Yixiao,

560
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,110
the price

561
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,720
is forgetting you.

562
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,760
If forgetting me

563
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,310
can keep you safe

564
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,070
and bring peace to the people

565
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,880
of Susha,

566
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
it's worth it.

567
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,440
Feng Suige.

568
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,040
I promise you,

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,600
no matter what happens,

570
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,640
whether you remember me or not,

571
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,170
I'll always be by your side.

572
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,550
Yixiao,

573
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,350
nothing in my heart

574
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,720
is more important than you.

575
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,920
If I have to forget you,

576
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,980
I cannot accept it.

577
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,220
And what about you?

578
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,390
How much would you suffer for me?

579
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,550
What if I never

580
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,680
remember you again?

581
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,590
Yixiao,

582
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,200
I cherish

583
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,530
everything we have now.

584
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,790
I don't want anything,

585
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,760
even with the slightest chance,

586
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,410
to destroy what we have between us.

587
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,440
Feng Suige,

588
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,950
I understand your concerns.

589
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,530
But do you remember before—

590
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,150
when I'd lost all my memories

591
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,240
and then met you?

592
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,840
It was you
who awakened me little by little.

593
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,790
If the roles are reversed this time,

594
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,440
and if the day truly comes

595
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,970
when you don't remember me,

596
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,390
we will still be like before,

597
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,050
getting to know each other all over again.

598
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,750
I promise you,

599
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,480
even if you forget everyone,

600
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,960
I'll find a way to make you remember me.

601
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,890
♪ Dreams turn through a lifetime ♪

602
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,900
♪ Who sighs for me,
enduring separations? ♪

603
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,160
♪ Love is a trial, harsh and cold ♪

604
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,380
Feng Suige,

605
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,100
♪ Who crushes the lingering pain for me? ♪

606
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,790
you'll never lose me.

607
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:40,990
♪ Clouds vanish, rain ceases, seek me ♪

608
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,580
Your Highness.

609
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,550
How are things going?

610
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,830
I've gained Wang Encheng's trust.

611
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,360
He's agreed to work with us.

612
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,240
Tonight, just as you planned,

613
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,110
he'll host a banquet for his colleagues

614
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,750
at Bowu Restaurant in Shengjing.

615
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,720
The invited guests

616
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,440
are all from the list

617
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,240
you provided.

618
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,890
Have you booked a private room?

619
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,000
Yes.

620
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,160
This is the map of the imperial palace.

621
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,730
I've marked a few spots.

622
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,170
Memorize them.

623
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,520
What's this for?

624
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,100
When we move against Xia Jingyan,

625
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,920
we must prepare

626
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,650
an escape route for ourselves.

627
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,680
Those locations

628
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,800
are guarded by our own people

629
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,140
and can be used when we escape.

630
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,920
After you memorize them,

631
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,110
destroy it.

632
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,510
Don't leave

633
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,370
any loose ends.

634
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,690
Understood.

635
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,080
I'll burn it right away.

636
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,010
And this Daily Chronicle—

637
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,080
I've memorized it well.

638
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,170
Burn this, too.

639
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,800
Understood.

640
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,720
[Wang Encheng, Minister of Revenue]

641
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,880
The Empress Dowager promoted me
to Minister of Revenue.

642
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,650
It should have brought great honor

643
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,030
to my entire family.

644
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,360
But outsiders don't know

645
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,960
that this position

646
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,110
was obtained at the cost

647
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,110
of my wife's honor.

648
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,200
My wife,

649
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,780
after being summoned by His Majesty,

650
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,760
drowned herself the very next day!

651
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,450
His Majesty

652
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,310
just rewarded me with a dancer

653
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,400
as a concubine,

654
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,890
calling her compensation for me!

655
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,640
My youngest son just turned
one month old days ago,

656
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,700
yet I didn't dare hold a celebration.

657
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,160
I'm afraid people would

658
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,420
gossip behind my back,

659
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,520
saying my son doesn't look like me.

660
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,960
My family has been loyal for generations,

661
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,020
yet we've been humiliated like this!

662
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,490
The Emperor is a tyrant!

663
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,400
Are you all

664
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,130
going to keep tolerating this?

665
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,240
What choice do we have?

666
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,770
He is the sovereign;

667
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,960
we are his subjects!

668
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,030
How I hate it!

669
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,850
The Emperor has no virtue or morality.

670
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,920
Why do we have to

671
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,380
suffer such humiliation?

672
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,250
What sin have we committed

673
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,110
to deserve this?

674
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,840
When patience runs out,

675
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,120
it's time to stop enduring!

676
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,720
So you all hate His Majesty

677
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,880
so much.

678
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,210
Gentlemen,

679
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,400
I have recorded

680
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,880
[Wang Encheng: When patience runs out,
it's time to stop enduring!]

681
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
every single word

682
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,520
you just said.

683
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,780
Speaking ill of His Majesty
is punishable by death.

684
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,270
You arranged this banquet.

685
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,160
You knew
the Prince of Zhennan was outside

686
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,920
and deliberately made us
speak out of turn!

687
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,640
It was you!

688
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,160
You set us up!

689
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,680
The Emperor is corrupt and lecherous.

690
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,750
He defiles officials' wives.

691
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,750
He's unworthy to rule this kingdom!

692
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,510
The Prince of Zhennan is
the late emperor's eldest son.

693
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,550
If not for the Empress Dowager
seizing power

694
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,920
after the late emperor's death,

695
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,640
how could that talentless

696
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
and immoral Xia Jingyan
have ascended the throne?

697
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,060
Are you still going to endure?

698
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,350
I can't take it anymore.

699
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,440
You're forcing us into ruin!

700
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,030
If this booklet is presented
to His Majesty,

701
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,640
you'll all be doomed as well.

702
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,940
Prince of Zhennan,

703
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,960
I have no grudge against you.

704
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,710
Why are you trying to harm me?

705
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,750
You are wrong.

706
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,950
The Prince of Zhennan isn't harming us.

707
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,640
He's here to save us.

708
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,650
He can deliver us from this misery.

709
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,610
Fellow colleagues,

710
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,330
this opportunity comes only once.

711
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,790
If we lose it,

712
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,480
we'll be doomed forever.

713
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,030
But the Prince of Zhennan
can barely protect himself,

714
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,240
let alone save us.

715
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,080
As long as I still breathe

716
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,970
and the fire of vengeance burns within me,

717
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,820
hope can be born from despair.

718
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,270
The humiliation you've suffered

719
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,870
is nothing compared to mine.

720
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,790
We share the same fate—

721
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,370
all the more reason to band together.

722
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,680
Don't you agree?

723
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,440
You're all

724
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,720
pillars of Jinxiu.

725
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,160
But because of that tyrant,

726
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,160
you've been forced to endure in silence.

727
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,640
From today on,

728
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,750
your revenge

729
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,030
is my revenge.

730
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,440
I will

731
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,400
take revenge for you.

732
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,310
I only need all of you

733
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,360
to help me with one thing.

734
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,130
Don't worry.

735
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,520
What I want is just a small favor

736
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,550
from all of you.

737
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,750
I'm at your service, Your Highness.

738
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,240
Your Highness, please tell us

739
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,120
what you want us to do.

740
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,310
Your Majesty,

741
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,960
Princess Xiyang

742
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,690
still refuses to eat anything.

743
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,160
Are you planning
to starve yourself to death?

744
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,200
Have you found

745
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,060
who killed my father and brother?

746
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
If she won't eat,

747
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,550
can't you feed her?

748
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,940
I'm asking you! Did you find the culprit?

749
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,200
If you still refuse to eat,

750
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
I will kill her.

751
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,720
No, please, Your Majesty!

752
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,240
Please.

753
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,000
Go.

754
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,240
Bring more food.

755
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,200
Yes.

756
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,000
Get up!

757
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,440
Spit it out! Now!

758
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,340
Spit it out!

759
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,210

00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,820
is also my wish.

947
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,800
I believe Heaven

948
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,030
will surely bless us.

949
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,330
You will definitely make it through this

950
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,000
and turn danger into safety.

951
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,670
Feng Suige.

952
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,720
You're awake.

953
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,070
Feng Suige.

954
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,030
Can you see?

955
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,670
Can you see me?

956
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:53,840
Lord Ling!

957
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,630
Feng Suige…

958
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,760
[Treatment Room]

959
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,360
Quick!

Feng Suige.

962
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,710
It's me.

963
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,840
It's me.

964
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,960
-Your Highness, you're awake!
-Suige, Suige!

965
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,230
Let go, let go!

966
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,190
Your Highness, let go!

967
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,150
Suige, let go!

968
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,210
What's happening?

969
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,000
Let's talk this through.

970
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,550
Don't fight!

971
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,480
Are you alright?

972
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,480
What's wrong, Your Highness?

973
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,590
Fu Yixiao!

974
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480

-Fu Yixiao!
-Suige!

976
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,710
Calm down, Your Highness.

977
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,400
Feng Suige,

978
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,590
don't you remember me?

979
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,320
It's me.

980
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,760
Don't you remember me?

981
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,590
Feng Suige,

982
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,960
go to hell.

983
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,110
Feng Suige.

984
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,000
Fu Yixiao.

985
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,630
You're dead!

986
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,550
How could this happen?

987
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,700
Yixiao, leave now!

988
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,550
Get out of here.

989
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,010
He's not himself anymore.

990
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,110
Feng Suige, it's me.

991
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,830
It's me.

992
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,280
You loser!

993
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:24,880
Your Highness!

994
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,550

Feng Suige.

996
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,590
Wake up!

997
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,190
