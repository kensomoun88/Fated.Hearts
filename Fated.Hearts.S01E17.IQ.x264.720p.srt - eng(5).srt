[Episode 17]

3
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,560
This is the first time

4
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,350
I've ever given a girl a gift.

5
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,630
You cannot refuse it.

6
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,240
Then I suppose I should be honored.

7
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,950
Should I

8
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,880
give you a generous gift in return?

9
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,390
After my mother passed away,

10
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,520
everyone close to me,

11
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,400
those I trusted,

12
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,840
either left or betrayed me.

13
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,400
I've long been used to

14
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,910
hiding how I really feel.

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,000
But with you,

16
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,040
I don't feel the need to hide anything.

17
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,620
You know what?

18
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,910
You were the first person

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,730
who ever said you'd protect me.

20
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,390
You were also the first to tell me

21
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,680
I didn't have to

22
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,880
lick my wounds alone.

23
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,840
I'm truly happy…

24
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,890
to have met you in this life.

25
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,170
What's gotten into you?

26
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,430
Are you feeling emotional

27
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,360
because of your sister's wedding?

28
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,340

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,720
Didn't you always complain

105
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,630
that the food at my manor

106
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,720
was too bland?

107
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,410
Today, I'll treat you to some tasty meat.

108

The roasted meat at my place

111
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,100
can't compare to this.

112
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,670
The roasted meat here

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,470
is the best in all of Yujing City.

114
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,860
But you're hardly ever in Yujing.

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,840

117
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,750
I didn't know.

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,910
Yao told me.

119
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,180
You specifically asked him about it?

120
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,510
Don't you usually

121
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,910
prefer light food?

122
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,180
Why are you adding so many spices?

123
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,210
You like spicy food, don't you?

124
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,750
Besides spicy food,
you also enjoy drinking.

125
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,030
Aside from garlic,

126
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,530
you're not picky at all.

127
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,290
You remember all that?

128
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,120
When did you notice?

129
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,390
You've been at my place

130

132
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,150
even pick up on that,

133
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,970
how could I command an army?

134
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,800
Since you're so observant,

135
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,550
do you also remember what Lu Ke

136
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,880
and Yun Fang like to eat?

137
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,750
They...

138
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,570
Eat while it's hot.

139
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,900
It won't taste as good once it's cold.

140
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,360
How is it?

141
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
It's really good.

142
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,320
Here.

143
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,920
You're so thoughtful.

144
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,720
I assume you've cared for

145
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,380
plenty of other women before.

146
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,870
Yes.

147
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,150
I've traveled far and wide

148
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,360
and met all kinds of people.

149
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,020
Naturally, I've crossed paths
with many women.

150
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,240
Some of them

151
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,960
said they wanted to stay and serve me

152
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,750
to thank me for saving their lives.

153
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,000
I couldn't drive them away,

154
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,440
so I just let them stay.

155
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,810
They were completely obedient to me.

156
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,480
Sounds like your years on the battlefield

157
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,740
were a little too easy.

158
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,390
What do you mean?

159
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,720
I've saved quite a few people

160
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,030
on the battlefield too.

161
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,750
Some of them were

162
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,080
handsome, down-on-their-luck scholars.

163
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,480
Like you, I was very kind.

164
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,630
If they wanted

165
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,790
to offer themselves
in return for my kindness,

166
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,270
I brought them all home.

167
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,360
They were perfect

168
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,790
for teaching

169
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,030
Fang and Shunzi.

170
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,750
It saved me a fortune on tutors.

171
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,360
Alright, stop making things up.

172
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,630
I was joking just now.

173
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,550
There weren't that many women

174
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,320
on the remote battlefields.

175
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,960
But I wasn't lying.

176
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,390
Fang told me himself—

177
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,670
I really did save

178
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,080
four or five broke scholars

179
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,140
and bring them home

180
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,410
to tutor the kids in reading and writing.

181
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,030
S-Seriously?

182
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,120
I don't remember any of that.

183
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,650
But Fang wouldn't lie to me.

184
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,280
Stop eating.

185
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,860
I was messing with you.

186
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,660
You actually believed me?

187
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,080
I knew I shouldn't have trusted you.

188
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,650
Why are you looking at me like that?

189
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,270
I'm just thinking about the rumors

190
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,720
that the First Prince of Susha

191
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,510
is ruthless and bloodthirsty.

192
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,140
Looking at you now,

193
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,240
I find those rumors ridiculous.

194
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,360
Not entirely.

195
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,510
Remember I told you

196
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,510
when I was young,

197
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,970
anyone who tried to hurt me

198
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,600
ended up dead by my hand?

199
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,670
Even back then,

200
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,990
the palace was full of rumors

201
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,390
that I was bloodthirsty.

202
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,720
Later, I went to war

203
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,030
and stained my hands with even more blood.

204
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,160
More and more people

205
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,120

207
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
The common folk

208
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,080
don't fear you.

209
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
They respect you.

210
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,480
The Vajra Defender looks scary.

211
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,010
That's why he subdues evil.

212

Without the commander

213

of the Feng Battalion
who intimidates the enemies,

214
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Susha wouldn't be

215
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,790
as peaceful as it is now.

216
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,790
It's rare to hear you

217

even a hint of fear toward me.

224
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,790
Didn't you say
we're the same kind of people?

225
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,050
When two of a kind meet,

226
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,800
what's there to be afraid of?

last night, Her Highness left Yujing

233

235
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,390
Why would Xiyang leave Susha

236

with the Prince of Zhennan?

237
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,950
Your Majesty,

238
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,570
I'll send men after her immediately.

239

No.

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,150
Tell the First Prince
he must bring them back!

242
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,600
Yes.

Greetings, Your Highness.

245
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,910
I failed in my duties.

Please punish me.

when changing shifts

249
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,870
this morning, they found

250
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,670
the guards on duty last night

251
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,870
had all been drugged.

252
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,560
The Princess and Xia Jingshi were gone.

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,720
Leave.

Your Highness.

256
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,790
What did the gate guards say?

257
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,120
Around a quarter
past midnight last night,

258
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,960
the Princess and Xia Jingshi

259
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,220
used an imperial token to leave the city.

260
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,270
An imperial token?

261
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,360
Xia Jingshi...

262
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,080
he must be heading back to Jinxiu.

263
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,910
To return to Jinxiu,

264
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
the fastest route

265
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,400
is straight east—

266
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,130
through Xishu City,
around Mount Changlong,

267
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,390
then past Guxi,

269
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,200
to reach the border.

270
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,910
They left at a quarter past midnight,

271
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,190
so by now,

272
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,270
they're probably

273
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,400

and gather

289

Before they reach the border,

291
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,600

pass through the bamboo forest
outside Fengyang.

00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:11,960
Yes!

379
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,070
Your Highness,

380
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,550
someone has already
headed for Qixia Valley.

381
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,700
I found a lot of hoofprints

382
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,210
near the valley.

383
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,210
Feng Suige's men must be ahead.

384
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,720
He knows we'll have to pass through

385
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,110
Qixia Valley on our way back.

386
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,510
They must be waiting ahead

387
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,260
to stop us.

388
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,180
Qixia Valley

389
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,270
is easy to defend but hard to breach.

390
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,550
If Feng Suige and his men

391
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,880
are lying in wait there,

392
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,790
we may not escape unharmed.

393
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,140
[Zhennan Pass] [Beiyan Pass]

394
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,490
[Qixia Valley] [Zhennan Pass]

395
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,340
[Beiyan Pass]

396
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,200
Forget Zhennan Pass.

397
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,640
Change course northward.

398
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,680
We'll head for

399
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,680
Jinxiu's Beiyan Pass.

400
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,440
Your Highness,

401
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,480
but Beiyan Pass isn't
part of the southern frontier.

402
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,380
If we go there,

403
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,280
the border troops will only

404
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,810
take us to Shengjing City.

405
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,110
You left Susha without permission.

406
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,720
That's already
disobeying the imperial edict.

407
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,550
If you're taken to Shengjing,

408
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,160
you'll be completely defenseless

409
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,960
with little chance of survival.

410
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,070
If I had a choice,

411
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,890
I wouldn't go to Shengjing either.

412
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,560
But if we continue forward,

413
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,830
Feng Suige will stop us for sure.

414
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,610
Better to take my chances in Shengjing

415
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,620
than be locked up in Susha.

416
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,730
Let's go.

417
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:43,750
Yes.

418
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,070
This way.

419
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Once we get through the gorge ahead,

420
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,590
we'll reach Jinxiu's Beiyan Pass.

421
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,390
Princess, you can rest easy now.

422
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,440
Feng Suige?

423
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,440
Wait.

424
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,680
If Xia Jingshi suspects

425
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,000
we're lying in wait at Qixia Valley,

426
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,570
[Beiyan Pass]

427
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,870
he'd rather detour

428
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,070
to Jinxiu's Beiyan Pass

429
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,730
than risk being stopped by me.

430
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,240
You and Yun Fang

431
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,680
take your men and head to Qixia Valley.

432
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,270
Gu Yu, come with me.

433
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:34,680
Yes.

434
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,240
Xia Jingshi!

435
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,430
With me here,

436
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,440
none of you are getting away.

437
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:57,900
Attack!

438
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,440
Brother,

439
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,790
please let us go.

440
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,350
I'm begging you, just let us go!

441
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,680
Don't come any closer!

442
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,160
Xiyang, put the knife down!

443
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,750
Leave!

444
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,920
Or I swear I'll die right here!

445
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,460
Don't be foolish, Xiyang.

446
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,950
Listen to me.

447
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,290
Put the knife down.

448
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,250
Brother,

449
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,310
all my life,

450
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,770
you've always spoiled me.

451
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,830
Why can't you

452
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,510
let me

453
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,350
follow my heart just this once?

454
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,880
How could you expect me
to stand by and watch

455
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,270
as you're trapped in an enemy country?

456
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,800
His Highness is my husband.

457
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,830
Going back to Jinxiu with him

458
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,960
is only natural.

459
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,310
He'll treat me well.

460
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,880
Xiyang,

461
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,940
I've never begged you for anything.

462
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,530
Let this be the first time.

463
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,730
Please, come home with me.

464
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,110
No.

465
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,720
Xia Jingshi!

466
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,510
If you're a real man,

467
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,240
get out here now!

468
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,270
Stop pushing me.

469
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,400
Do you really want me to die?

470
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,460
Xiyang!

471
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,480
Brother!

472
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,650
Your Highness.

473
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,260
Your Highness.

474
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,200
Your Highness.

475
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,330
Don't hurt my brother!

476
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,030
Brother!

477
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,640
Brother!

478
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,920
If you still see me as family,

479
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,820
let us go.

480
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,350
Everyone,

481
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,480
retreat!

482
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,020
Your Highness.

483
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,510
Stop!

484
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,550
Let them go.

485
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,880
Princess, you'd better think this through.

486
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,770
There's no turning back from here.

487
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,880
If you want to stay,

488
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,400
get off the carriage now.

489
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,330
There's no turning back for me now.

490
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,920
Wherever you go,

491
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,200
that's where I'll be.

492
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,640
Your hand recovery

493
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,590
will take time.

494
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,000
Even though you've regained

495
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,270
some strength in your left hand,

496
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,240
you mustn't overexert it,

497
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,050
or this hand will be permanently damaged.

498
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,610
Your Highness,

499
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,880
Military Advisor Xiao is injured.

500
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,010
Shall we stop ahead to rest for a while?

501
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:53,840
Alright.

502
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,480
Greetings, Prince of Zhennan.

503
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,260
Your Highness,

504
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,889
these are the soldiers
stationed at Beiyan Pass.

505
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,110
The Emperor has been informed

506
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,030
of your unauthorized
departure from Susha.

507
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,920
Please, Prince of Zhennan,

508
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,580
return with us to the capital
to see His Majesty.

509
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,150
Fine.

510
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,800
I ordered you to guard Yujing City

511
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,510
and watch over the royal villa.

512
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,320
And this is how

513
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,150
you all fulfilled your duties?

514
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,670
How impressive.

515
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,580
Here in Susha,

516
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,630
the Prince of Zhennan comes

517
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,710
and goes as he pleases.

518
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,240
What use are any of you to me?

519
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,130
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

520
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,730
We deserve death for letting

521
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,420
the Prince of Zhennan escape.

522
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,670
But…

523
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,480
But what?

524
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,400
Are you trying to say
I've wrongly accused you?

525
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,120
I wouldn't dare.

526
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,030
It's just that

527
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,230
the Princess had an imperial token.

528
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,750
As a city gate official,

529
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,280
I didn't dare defy it.

530
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,210
What did you say?

531
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,230
The Princess must have

532
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,010
stolen Your Majesty's token.

533
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,510
That's how she was able

534
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,030
to leave Susha

535
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,230
without resistance.

536
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
The Princess is young and reckless.

537
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,880
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.

538
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,770
She actually...

539
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,680
Your Majesty!

540
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,960
Leave!

541
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,230
Or I swear I'll die right here!

542
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,760
You're awake.

543
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,240
You fell asleep here all alone.

544
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,760
I was afraid you'd get cold,
so I made a fire.

545
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,290
Drink this.

546
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,360
It'll warm you up.

547
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,070
Didn't I tell you

548
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,330
to stay in Yujing City?

549
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,850
Why are you here?

550
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,440
I had nothing to do, so I came.

551
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,150
But how did you know

552
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,670
we were heading

553
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,130
for Jinxiu's Beiyan Pass?

554
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,360
After leaving Yujing,

555
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,360
I was heading toward Pingling City,

556
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,360
but on the way,

557
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,030
I saw

558
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,550
carriage tracks
leading toward Beiyan Pass.

559
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,810
I figured it was Xia Jingshi's carriage,

560
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,840
so I followed.

561
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,400
Once they pass this desert,

562
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,460
they'll reach Jinxiu's border soon.

563
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,230
By now, Xiyang is

564
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,800
probably already

565
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,230
on her way to Shengjing.

566
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,000
When our mother died,

567
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,960
Xiyang was only four.

568
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,350
I swore then

569
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,280
that I'd protect her for life.

570
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,510
But now I realize—

571
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,880
no matter what I do,

572
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,280
no matter how hard I try,

573
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,450
it never seems to be enough.

574
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,020
You didn't do anything wrong.

575
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,660
You did everything you could.

576
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,320
It was her decision.

577
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,880
She already seemed off

578
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,590
on her wedding day.

579
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,400
I should've noticed then

580
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,440
that she'd made up her mind

581
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,900
to leave with Xia Jingshi.

582
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,840
If I had stopped her then,

583
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,320
she wouldn't

584
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,650
have ended up like this.

585
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,120
She had made up her mind.

586
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,370
But even if you had seen it coming,

587
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,000
what could you have changed?

588
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,590
All I can do now

589
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,840
is pray she'll be happy.

590
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,170
That's wishful thinking.

591
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,190
Someone who could've

592
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,790
brought himself to kill you—

593
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,480
how could he ever

594
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,680
make my sister happy?

595
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,110
I knew fully well

596
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,190
that Jinxiu would be

597
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,390
a living hell for her.

598
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,100
And yet as her brother,

599
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,280
I could only watch

600
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,480
as she walked straight

601
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,320
toward ruin.

602
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,150
She's the Princess of Susha.

603
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,710
How is she supposed to fend for herself

604
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,840
in Jinxiu all alone?

605
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,930
Whatever the future holds,

606
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,110
at least she's safe now.

607
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,320
The two nations just made peace.

608
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,110
Xia Jingshi

609
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,670
wouldn't dare harm her.

610
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,830
Don't think too much.

611
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,260
We'll head back

612
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,880
to Yujing at first light.

613
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,640
I haven't asked you—

614
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,190
you shot all those arrows

615
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,400
from so far away today.

616
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,330
How's your hand?

617
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,920
It's fine.

618
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,600
I didn't use much strength.

619
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,340
Don't lie to me.

620
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,410
It's too windy here.

621
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,910
Let's go back to the tent.

622
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,190
Let me see.

623
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,560
What's wrong?

624
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,360
Nothing. Let's just go.

625
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,140
Don't move.

626
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,630
It's really fine.

627
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,340
Stop looking.

628
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,560
You call this fine?

629
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,630
It's really fine.

630
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,760
Can you even move your hand?

631
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,880
Don't make a fuss.

632
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,190
It'll heal in a few days.

633
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,320
Did you forget

634
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
what Lord Ling told you?

635
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,760
I couldn't care about that.

636
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,510
I couldn't just stand by

637
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,480
and watch you get hurt.

638
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,920
And I can't just stand by and watch you

639
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,590
become a wreck

640
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,400
trying to protect me.

641
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,480
So what if I'm a wreck?

642
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,810
You think I'm a wreck now

643
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,760
and despise me?

644
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,440
Feng Suige, listen carefully.

645
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,360
Even if I become a wreck,

646
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,550
I won't regret it.

647
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,860
