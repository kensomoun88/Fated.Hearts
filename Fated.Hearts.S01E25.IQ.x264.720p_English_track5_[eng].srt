[Fated Hearts]

2
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,020
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,229
You don't understand
my painstaking efforts,

4
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,789
nor the righteousness I uphold
for both family and country!

5
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:49,850
Do you understand?

6
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,759
The so-called family and country—

7
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,229
family comes before country!

8
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,640
You don't even care for your family—

9
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,370
what right do you have
to speak of righteousness?

10
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,640
What did you say?

11
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,680
Only a ruler

12
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,000
who governs with grace and composure

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
can be called a wise emperor.

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,240
To be a good monarch,

15
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,810
one must first be a good person.

16
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,520
Kill her.

17
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,370
This woman cannot be allowed to live.

18
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,560
She said the exact same thing

19
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,829
as your mother did.

20
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,750
Shut this wretch up!

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,190
Say one more insulting word to her
and you'll see.

22
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,240
Suige,

23
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,840
I thought after your mother's death,

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,970
you would finally come to your senses.

25
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,750
But now there's another woman

26
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,710
like her by your side.

27
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,310
Suige,

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,150
for Susha's sake,

29
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,030
I'm begging you—

30
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,400
this woman cannot stay alive.

31
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,910
Kill her!

32
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,150
Listen!

33
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,490
You've already ruined

34
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,870
the first half of Feng Suige's life.

35
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,240
I, Fu Yixiao, will never let you

36
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,430
ruin the rest of it!

37
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,470
Kill her!

38
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,120
Kill her!

39
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,120
Suige.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,560
Suige.

41
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,910
Suige!

42
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,910
Wei Qingyu.

43
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,560
Wei Qingyu...

44
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,080
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,330
I lost control just now.

46
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,530
Don't take what he said

47
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,630
to heart.

48
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,110
Please don't be angry, alright?

49
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,960
I should thank you
for what you did just now.

50
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,890
You stood up for me inside there

51
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,620
and considered things from my perspective.

52
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,360
But what you said really does sound

53
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,620
just like something my mother would say.

54
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,400
I think...

55
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,960
any decent person

56
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,670
would say the same thing.

57
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,270
What?

58
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,480
Don't tell me

59
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,940
you want to call me Mother.

60
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,480
I wouldn't mind

61
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,280
being someone like your mother.

62
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,070
Alright.

63
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,680
Stop crying.

64
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,660
I'm not crying.

65
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,440
It was just the sandstorm earlier.

66
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,040
How could there be a sandstorm
inside the room?

67
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,770
I don't care.

68
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,930
There was a lot of sand anyway.

69
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,510
Don't worry.

70
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,890
With me here,

71
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,430
no sandstorm will ever

72
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,360
reach you again.

73
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,120
Ma Qiming,

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,730
you know all of this, don't you?

75
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,370
How dare you ask me
to come here to save him?

76
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,850
You're leaving too?

77
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,750
I never imagined

78
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,160
you would treat Suige like this
all these years.

79
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,920
And I never thought

80
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,050
Qingyu would die right in front of you!

81
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,440
Feng Pingcheng,

82
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,750
from now on, we're completely done—

83
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,130
whether living or dead.

84
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,630
Before I leave, I'll tell you

85
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,630
one last thing.

86
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,630
All these years, the reason

87
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,159
I went all out to save you

88
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,920
was that Qingyu asked me to.

89
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,870
You've been trying so hard

90
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,000
to defeat Qingyu,

91
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,430
yet he was the one

92
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,090
who actually saved your life.

93
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,480
Move.

94
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,450
It's been the whole day.

95
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,600
How could so many people

96
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,630
still not have found His Majesty?

97
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,430
Your Majesty,

98
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,030
the Imperial Guards said so.

99
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,270
They've searched the entire Yujing City

100
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,920
and found no trace of His Majesty.

101
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,760
No one knows

102
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,800
where he went.

103
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,500
Prepare the carriage.

104
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,310
I'll go find His Majesty myself.

105
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,560
-So many people are looking for him.
-Yes.

106
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,159
You won't make a difference.

107
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,000
Leave us.

108
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,000
Father.

109
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,920
Where has His Majesty gone?

110
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,040
No need to ask so many questions.

111
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,970
Pack your things

112
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,800
and take Chengyang out of the palace
for safety.

113
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,870
What happened?

114
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,690
His Majesty is not in the palace.

115
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,040
It's not safe here.

116
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,810
Father,

117
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,890
how could the palace be unsafe?

118
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,000
Is Feng Suige

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,130
acting crazy again?

120
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,830
He has no right to run wild

121
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,360
in the land of Sushan yet.

122
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,720
Go tell Chengyang to pack up.

123
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,150
You're leaving tonight.

124
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
What exactly happened to His Majesty?

125
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,070
Father,

126
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,120
what are you afraid of?

127
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,410
As long as you know nothing

128
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,950
about what I'm doing,

129
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,040
you won't be implicated.

130
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,630
At this point,

131
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,490
what are you still hiding from me?

132
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,600
You don't even

133
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,390
listen to me.

134
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,570
Why won't you tell me the truth?

135
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,080
What exactly are you planning to do?

136
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,659
Why do you refuse to tell me?

137
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,020
All these years,

138
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,960
Feng Pingcheng has also been
keeping secrets from me,

139
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,480
never telling me

140
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,550
about his illness.

141
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,670
Father,

142
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,200
what are you planning to do?

143
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,600
Tell me.

144
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,480
I've had enough!

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,670
Am I not a member of the Zhuang family?

146
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,830
Am I not the Empress?

147
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,510
Am I not Chengyang's mother?

148
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
Why has all the truth

149
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,080
been kept from me?

150
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,200
Fine.

151
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,440
I'm

152
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,620
going to avenge your brother.

153
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,550
My brother?

154
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,390
Avenge?

155
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,510
Your brother was killed

156
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,570
by Feng Pingcheng.

157
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,670
What nonsense are you talking about?

158
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,370
He was executed for treason.

159
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,550
Treason?

160
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,980
Feng Pingcheng caused his death!

161
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,520
Impossible.

162
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,520
He committed treason.

163
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,440
His entire clan should have been executed,

164
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,910
but Feng Pingcheng showed mercy

165
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,120
and spared the Zhuang family.

166
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,440
Feng Pingcheng has long wanted

167
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,840
to eliminate our family.

168
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,130
He fears our influence

169
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,630
and resents us
for the late empress's death.

170
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,360
He's been holding hatred toward us.

171
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,090
He's wanted to destroy our family
for a long time.

172
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,480
If it weren't for your brother

173
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,220
taking all the blame,

174
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,970
our family would have been wiped out
long ago.

175
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,200
Impossible.

176
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,270
Absolutely impossible.

177
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,470
I wouldn't lie to you.

178
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,790
I kept the truth from you

179
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,840
to protect you

180
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,700
and Chengyang.

181
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,710
Now that you're asking,

182
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,630
I'm telling you everything.

183
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,500
I don't believe it.

184
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,870
Are you saying that all these years

185
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,730
I've been sleeping with our enemy

186
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,910
and serving the man

187
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,380
who killed my brother?

188
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,630
You two are my only children.

189
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,260
I couldn't save your brother back then.

190
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,870
I must keep you safe at all costs.

191
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,510

380
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,960
with you or the Murong family.

381
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,680
I'll bear the consequences alone.

382
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,560
So...

383
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,020
everything...

384
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,690
everything she said was true?

385
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
They are all true?

386
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,790
You wouldn't dare rebel on your own.

387
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,650
Tell me who your accomplice is.

388
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,830
Is it that old fox Zhuang Shen?

389
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,640
Yes.

390
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,680
He promised me

391
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,750
that once Feng Chengyang
ascends to the throne,

392
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,750
the Murong family

393
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,800
will be granted the title
of a royal house of Susha.

394
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,140
You're being foolish.

395
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,070
Father,

396
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm perfectly clear-headed.

397
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,660
I know exactly what I'm doing.

398
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,620
Feng Suige told me long ago

399
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,960
that he would never take the throne.

400
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,200
He's a man of his word

401
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,100
who never lies.

402
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,350
But if he doesn't become the emperor,

403
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,150
how can we become a royal family?

404
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,350
I had no choice
but to ally with the Zhuang family—

405
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,310
to join forces with that old fox,

406
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,200
Zhuang Shen—

407
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,240
to fulfill my lifelong wish.

408
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,330
Even His Majesty knows

409
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
one must never raise a tiger
that could later turn on him.

410
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,480
Do you think Zhuang Shen

411
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,590
would let his grandson-in-law

412
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,240
have a powerful rival outside?

413
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,030
Once he's done using you,

414
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,310
he'll get rid of you!

415
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,070
How could you believe

416
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,680
that old bastard's nonsense?

417
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,370
I have proof of his treason!

418
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,830
If he dares go back on his word,

419
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,800
I'll drag him down with me!

420
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,270
He wouldn't dare.

421
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,440
Father,

422
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,790
by then,

423
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,920
our whole family will be able to

424
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,780
move to Xijing.

425
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,530
Shut up.

426
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,030
This is what the Murong family

427
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,000
rightfully deserves!

428
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,720
Shut up!

429
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,610
After being granted the title,

430
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,640
you'll never have to garrison

431
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,200
the freezing borderlands again.

432
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,890
You can spend

433
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,680
-your remaining years in comfort.
-Shut up!

434
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,160
Father.

435
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,240
Shut up!

436
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,960
Father.

437
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:08,730
Father.

438
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,860
Your leg...

439
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,570
Father!

440
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:11,900
Father,

441
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,880
your leg...

442
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,070
Father,

443
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,960
if I don't do this,

444
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,110
you'll sooner or later
die worn out at the frontier.

445
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,070
If Feng Pingcheng had even

446
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,880
a shred of decency toward you,

447
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,610
he wouldn't treat you this way.

448
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,350
Am I wrong to want to kill him?

449
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,790
If he doesn't die,

450
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,880
you will, Father.

451
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,060
You've worked hard your entire life.

452
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,720
Don't you deserve

453
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,920
a few days of peace?

454
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
I'm not doing this

455
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,830
for myself;

456
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,270
I'm doing it for the Murong family.

457
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,350
I can't accept it!

458
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,720
Why should the Murong family

459
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,050
be trampled under the Feng family's feet?

460
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,480
How many times have I told you?

461
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,350
This is our fate.

462
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,850
I don't believe it.

463
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,200
Father,

464
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,330
I don't believe in fate!

465
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,130
I've fought in battles all my life.

466
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,350
I fear nothing—

467
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,820
not even death.

468
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,330
The only thing I fear

469
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,830
is something happening to you.

470
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,070
When

471
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,830
I'm wronged or mistreated,

472
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,350
I never dare to argue or complain,

473
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,160
always holding back.

474
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,240
As long as you can live healthy and safe,

475
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,110
I'm content.

476
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,800
Father...

477
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,790
Yao,

478
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,640
there's something you must remember:

479
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,550
everyone makes mistakes.

480
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,030
But when you're wrong, you must admit it

481
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,110
and make it right.

482
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,680
But as long as I'm still alive,

483
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,760
you don't need

484
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,240
to shoulder any burdens.

485
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,780
As long as I'm here,

486
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,710
you don't need to be afraid of anything.

487
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,830
All of you, come in!

488
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,640
I know you

489
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,200
are loyal to the Young Master.

490
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,030
But

491
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
it's precisely this loyalty

492
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,030
that has led him to this deadly situation!

493
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,160
I'll put aside each of your crimes

494
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,880
for now.

495
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,630
If you don't want him to die,

496
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,790
carry him back
to the Marquis's Mansion now

497
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,240
and keep a close watch on him.

498
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,970
Understand?

499
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,960
Yes, My Lord.

500
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,270
Go find me some thorny branches.

501
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:36,480
Tomorrow I'll enter the palace
to see His Majesty

502
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,490
and ask him to punish me.

503
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,790
Your Majesty.

504
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,320
Your Majesty, are you back?

505
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,200
Your Majesty.

506
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,420
Your Majesty, how are you?

507
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,480
Your Majesty,

508
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
please say something.

509
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,740
I'm worried about you.

510
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,870
Your Majesty,

511
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,830
I want to talk to you about something.

512
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,680
Could we speak in...

513
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,210
There's nothing left to say

514
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,350
between us.

515
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,550
My father told me

516
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,790
the cause of my brother's death.

517
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,920
Is what he said true?

518
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,480
Yes.

519
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,590
You didn't even ask me

520
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,860
what my father told me.

521
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,310
I don't care.

522
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,480
Your Majesty,

523
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,960
His Majesty is tired.

524
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
-He needs to go back to rest.
-Your Majesty!

525
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,240
If you still care about the bond

526
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,790
between us as husband and wife,

527
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,190
please tell me the truth!

528
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,550
Prepare to depart!

529
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,520
Your Majesty!

530
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,310
Zhuang has returned to his residence.

531
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,960
Go keep an eye on him.

532
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,930
Let's go.

533
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,710
[Zhuang Residence]

534
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,570
What are you doing here?

535
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,090
Didn't I tell you to get some rest?

536
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
I couldn't sleep.

537
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,920
Then why didn't you call me
when you got here?

538
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,520
I didn't want to disturb you.

539
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,500
What about you?

540
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,510
Why are you still up at this hour?

541
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,640
Where are you going?

542
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,350
I was worried that you couldn't sleep,

543
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,810
so I wanted to check on you.

why didn't you send people

555
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,840
to kill Feng Pingcheng?

556
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,430
Once Feng Pingcheng dies,

557
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:32,830
with you

558
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,830
and Her Majesty here,

559
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,830
the Zhuang family can still...

560
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,090
What I want is revenge.

561
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,660
Don't you understand?

562
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,840
I understand, Uncle.

563
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,920
No, you don't.

564
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,960
You have no vengeance in your heart—

565
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,440
only a desire for power.

566
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,750
Jingheng was my only son

567
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,750
and my only hope.

568
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,790
I've stayed alive

569
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,790
not for power

570
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,920
but to avenge him.

571
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,440
Can I trust you?

572
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:13,920
Yes.

573
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,670
I will kill Feng Suige

574
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,750
and make Feng Pingcheng

575
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,480
suffer the pain of losing a son.

576
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,520
I will personally cut off his head.

577
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,330
Yes.

578
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,570
Complete this task,

579
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,320
and you'll be the Zhuang family's
greatest hero.

580
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,830
The Zhuang family will be yours

581
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,640
in the future.

582
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,960
After Chengyang ascends to the throne,

583
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,000
you will be the head of the Zhuang family

584
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,720
and

585
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,740
the most powerful minister in Susha.

586
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,640
Don't worry, Uncle.

587
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,830
I would rather die than fail this mission.

588
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,440
You may leave now.

589
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,480
Let me be alone for a while.

590
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,910
Your Majesty,

591
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,600
Her Majesty...

592
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,070
[Changchun Palace]

593
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,200
still wishes to see you.

594
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,550
Ignore her.

595
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,270
I need some peace.

596
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,070
Yes.

597
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,370
Feng Pingcheng,

598
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,960
listen.

599
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,000
I will never let Suige

600
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,600
follow in your footsteps

601
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,000
and be trapped by power like you.

602
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,700
My child's future path

603
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,070
will be determined by himself alone.

604
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,280
All these years, the reason

605
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,760
I went all out to save you

606
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,330
was that Qingyu asked me to.

607
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,280
You've been trying so hard

608
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
to defeat Qingyu,

609
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,800
yet she was the one

610
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,460
who actually saved your life.

611
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,440
I thought

612
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,659
I would undoubtedly win over you,

613
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,760
yet in the end, I still lost.

614
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,550
Oh, right,

615
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,960
you don't like it when I use

616
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,780
the royal term to refer to myself.

617
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,840
Fine.

618
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,510
As you wish.

619
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,810
As you wish.

620
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,480
Our bond as husband and wife is long gone.

621
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,760
Why did you have Ling Feng save me?

622
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,550
Why did you send him to save me?

623
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,070
You always said I've changed,

624
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,230
that after becoming emperor

625
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
I was blinded by power.

626
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,280
But it was you who never saw clearly.

627
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,920
It was you who deceived yourself

628
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,360
with wishful thinking.

629
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,110
I have always been who I am.

630
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,150
My father starved to death.

631
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,190
After he died,

632
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,070
my mother and I
wandered from place to place.

633
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,610
I grew up in a refugee camp,

634
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,190
fighting with others for scraps of food
from the dead.

635
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,070
If we hadn't fought for food,

636
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,150
my mother would've starved to death too.

637
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,800
At that time,

638
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,400
I learned one thing:

639
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,550
If you don't fight

640
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,880
and seize,

641
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,630
you die.

642
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,800
Wei Qingyu.

643
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,440
Wei Qingyu.

644
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,400
I'm leaving the world
I fought for with my life

645
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,510
to our son.

646
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,750
Am I wrong?

647
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,630
Am I wrong?

648
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,070
Am I wrong?

649
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,710
Am I wrong?

650
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,280
You're awake?

651
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,840
I haven't slept this peacefully

652
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
in a long time.

653
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,590
You were talking nonstop

654
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,150
in your sleep.

655
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,960
What did I say?

656
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,000
I won't tell you.

657
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,000
I've remembered
all the good things you said

658
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,800
and forgotten

659
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,400
the bad ones for you.

660
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,110
I hope I didn't

661
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,630
say anything bad

662
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,930
about you in my dreams.

663
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,090
Then I definitely can't tell you.

664
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,710
I hold grudges easily—

665
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,630
especially against you.

666
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,570
You only hold grudges against me?

667
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,480
Of course.

668
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,960
I've long forgotten

669
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,360
everyone else's,

670
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,030
but the ones about you—

671
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,360
I'll never forget.

672
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,550
You too.

673
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,070
What do you mean?

674
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,770
You can only hold grudges against me.

675
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,290
Don't ever keep the hurt

676
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,830
others caused you in your heart,

677
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,760
and don't ever use it to hurt yourself.

678
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,270
Why are you laughing?

679
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,730
I just thought of an old saying:

680
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,630
comb your hair once,
and all your worries fade;

681
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,890
comb it twice, and you'll be free
from sickness and sorrow;

682
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:01,110
comb it three times,
and we will live in harmony;

683
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,910
comb it four times,
and we'll be together forever.

684
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,800
It's obvious

685
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,730
you made up the last ones yourself.

686
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,480
Who would want
to be together with you forever?

687
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,190
Once I've avenged my mother,

688
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,070
we'll live in harmony

689
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,890
and be together forever. Alright?

690
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,960
Alright.

691
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,880
Miss Yixiao.

692
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,620
Miss Yixiao, are you in your room?

693
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,230
I just went to His Highness's chamber

694
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,150
to look for him,

695
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:33,760
but he wasn't there.

696
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,630
Do you know where he went?

697
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,030
I have something urgent.

698
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,440
Well...

699
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,190
Why are you looking for me?

700
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,670
Nothing.

701
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,090
Your Highness,

702
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,710
I do have

703
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,420
some small matters to report.

704
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,880
The elite soldiers of the Feng Battalion

705
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,480
have assembled

706
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,440
at the city gates,

707
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:54,960
and the Hound

708
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,880
has come back with the brothers

709
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,230
in the Qiongqi Unit.

710
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,110
Got it.

711
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,400
Tell the Hound to wait for me
in the study.

712
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:00,960
Yes.

713
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,590
No rush.

714
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:12,600
[Linfang Hall]

715
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,650
I didn't expect you

716
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,440
to send word

717
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,670
and ask to see me.

718
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,920
The flowers are blooming beautifully
today.

719
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,440
Your Highness, won't you pick a few?

720
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,170
Your Majesty,
you did that on purpose yesterday?

721
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:21,840
I was certain

722
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,630
you wouldn't dare tell Xia Jingshi

723
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,490
about our meeting in the Library,

724
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,610
so I lent you a hand.

725
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,840
Did you enjoy

726
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,800
those Susha delicacies?

727
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,800
Your Majesty, I don't deserve

728
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,840
such great favor.

729
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,840
Please don't trouble yourself

730
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,370
with trivial matters like this
in the future.

731
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,060
How could anything

732
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
concerning you be a trivial matter?

733
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,400
No matter how big or small the matter,

734
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,230
it's between His Highness

735
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,000
and me—

736
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,270
it has nothing to do with you.

737
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,480
What?

738
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,350
Are you angry?

739
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,360
Are you angry that I ruined things

740
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,960
between you and Xia Jingshi?

741
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,250
He shows no appreciation for your beauty,

742
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,590
yet you still care so deeply for him.

743
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,650
I've said everything I needed to say.

744
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,260
I'll take my leave now.

745
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,960
What's so great about Xia Jingshi

746
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,000
that all of you treat him

747
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,330
like the moon in the sky?

748
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,190
Let go of me!

749
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,490
All you Xias are sick!

750
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,230
One's heartless,

751
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,560
and the other's insane!

752
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,280
Heartless?

753
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,070
So you've finally seen

754
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,600
Xia Jingshi's true nature.

755
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,840
My Lord,

756
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,150
your legs are weak.

757
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,630
Why did you put yourself through this?

758
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,830
Is His Majesty

759
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,190
in Changchun Palace?

760
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,440
Yes.

761
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,050
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

762
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,200
Your Majesty.

763
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:22,710
Get lost!

764
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,240
Your Majesty,

765
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,370
Elder Marquis Murong is here.

766
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,670
I won't see him.

767
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,150
He's carrying thorny branches on his back—

768
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,000
it seems he's here
to ask for your punishment.
