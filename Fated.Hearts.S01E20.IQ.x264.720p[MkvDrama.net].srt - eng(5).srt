00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,770
[Fated Hearts]

2
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,990
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,610
The person who took Ruyan's carriage

4
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,840
to meet Xia Jingshi

5
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,300
was actually
in the Murong Marquis mansion.

6
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,840
The benefactor Ruyan mentioned

7
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,600
turned out to be Murong Yao.

8
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,470
Let's go.

9
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,310
You're letting me go?

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,470
Yes.

11
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,030
Why?

12
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,960
I've already found out

13
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,690
who that Meng Junran really is.

14
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,870
Impossible.

15
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,470
The Murong Marquis mansion.

16
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,240
Do you need me

17
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,370
to be more specific?

18
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,740
You're deeply devoted to him.

19
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,360
But he didn't even bother to find out

20
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,760
if you betrayed him or not

21
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
before sending someone to kill you.

22
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,830
It shows that in his heart

23
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,560
you're just

24
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,220
an insignificant character.

25
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,000
After all this,

26
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,310
you should see

27
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,640
his true colours by now.

28
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,310
He doesn't deserve

29
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,640
any of your attachment.

30
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,050
Don't talk about dying so easily.

31
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,520
Live well.

32
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,590
After you leave this place,

33
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,050
you'll still be in danger.

34
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,520
He will surely send people
to hunt you down.

35
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,500
Don't go back to the dance house.

36
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,900
Don't look for him again.

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,750
Leave Yujing City

38
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,600
and start a new life.

39
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,520
Before I change my mind,

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,930
you'd better leave.

41
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,079
Hurry and leave!

42
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,150
Feng Suige asked you

43
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,880
about the escort agency today?

44
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,480
As you instructed before,

45
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,930
I said it was commissioned by Manager Luo.

46
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,870
Manager Luo's lead is a dead end.

47
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,330
He can't answer anything.

48
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,000
Your Lordship, you been tired all day.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,720
May I massage your legs?

50
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,190
No need.

51
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,220
All these years,

52
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,240
you've never asked what I want to do

53
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,370
or what I wish to do.

54
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,930
Aren't you curious?

55
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,240
No matter what Your Lordship wants to do

56
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,100
or wishes to do,

57
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,720
I will

58
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,180
forever stay by your side.

59
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,160
Young Master,

60
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,240
don't go!

61
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,480
All right.

62
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,290
Let me see what we'll eat later.

63
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,270
Stop looking.

64
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,270
-Let's go there.
-Let's go there.

65
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,800
Go.

66
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,130
-Okay.
-Go there. Okay.

67
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,830
Hurry!

68
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,070
Someone's coming.

69
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,600
Retreat!

70
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,310
You want to die?

71
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,310
It's not that easy.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,120
Feng Suige.

73
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,870
Don't be happy too soon.

74
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,750
Your doomsday

75
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,070
is coming.

76
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,430
How come the mighty death camp.

77
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,240
only

78
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,360
have this few people?

79
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,430
Take them away.

80
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,120
-Yes.
-Yes.

81
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,220
Your Highness.

82
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,360
I've checked the surroundings

83
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,090
and found nothing suspicious.

84
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,720
[Wutong Mansion]

85
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,200
Your Highness.

86
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,840
Let's use every torture device we have.

87
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,170
She'll surely confess.

88
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,360
Wake her up.

89
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,850
Salt water.

90
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,560
The Minister of War of Susha

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,200
had no grudges against your death camp.

92
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,260
You killed him

93
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,600
just for him

94
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,560
to be a scapegoat and shield.

95
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,330
Everyone at court knows

96
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,720
Hou Jing is my man.

97
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,360
If something happens to him,

98
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,160
I'll be isolated at court.

99
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,830
The position of Minister of War

100
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,830
will be vacant.

101
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,190
Your master

102
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,130
can then seize the opportunity
to appoint someone new.

103
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,760
The affairs of Susha's court

104
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,770
have nothing to do with me.

105
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,549
So Zhuang Shen sent you, did he?

106
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,320
Kill me if you want.

107
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,090
Stop wasting time.

108
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,960
I wonder.

109
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,870
You can withstand them,

110
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,840
but can your subordinates withstand

111
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,290
these tortures of mine?

112
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,770
Your Highness.

113
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,120
He confessed?

114
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,900
Yes, he did.

115
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,960
I thought that man

116
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,120
would be tough to break.

117
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,850
But as soon as the nails went in,

118
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,330
he confessed everything.

119
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,030
He's dead?

120
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,840
He kept muttering from the moment
we brought them in,

121
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
like he was chanting a spell.

122
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,060
Your Highness, I feel these people

123
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,120
are all a bit mentally unstable.

124
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,670
I'm asking how he died.

125
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,750
He confessed after just a brief beating.

126
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,510
Said it was someone

127
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,030
named Meng Junran who gave the order.

128
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,600
"Your Eminence"

129
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,790
instructed before leaving Yujing

130
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,550
to obey everything Meng Junran says.

131
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,550
"Your Eminence"?

132
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,850
That's Xia Jingshi.

133
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,150
I thought we were getting somewhere,

134
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,000
but this guy

135
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,890
was just trying

136
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
to mislead me even when confessing.

137
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,120
When I wasn't looking,

138
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,440
he smashed his head and died.

139
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,750
The more I hear, the more I think

140
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,510
this death camp is complicated.

141
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,000
These assassins

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,320
have been trained to be inhuman.

143
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,120
They're completely heartless.

144
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,790
Where's the body?

145
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Still in the cell.

I've been following you

155
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,870
just to see

156
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,000
how you would leave.

157
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,030
I didn't think you would

158
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,600
still go to Murong Marquis's mansion.

159
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,480
What's more surprising is

160
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,540
that you wanted to take your own life.

161
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,550
Why did you save me?

162
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,420
Wouldn't it be better to let me die?

163
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,360
Die for him?

164
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,350
Is it worth it?

165
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,310
If you jump from here now,

166
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,200
tomorrow Yujing City

167
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,510
will just have one more floating corpse.

168
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,970
Nothing else will change.

169
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,870
In his heart,

170
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,200
you're already dead.

171
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,720
Dead...

172
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,440
Actually, that day

173
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,000
when I tracked you
to Murong Marquis's mansion,

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,720
I already knew

175
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,850
Meng Junran was him.

176
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,270
I just hoped

177
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,910
to hear you

178
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,840
say his name.

179
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Because only then

180
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,970
could it prove that

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,460
you had already let him go.

182
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,440
I'm not someone

183
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,080
who meddles in others' affairs.

184
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,000
It's only because
we share similar experiences.

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,660
The suffering I once endured,

186
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,720
I don't want it

187
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,840
to happen to you.

188
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
I just don't understand.

189
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
How could someone I'd rather die

190
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,320
than to betray

191
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,200
be so cruel to me?

192
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,400
His heartlessness is his fault.

193
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,320
Don't blame it on yourself.

194
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,440
But is the reason you'd rather die

195
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,400
than betray him

196
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,590
just because you have feelings for him?

197
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,520
If it weren't for him,

198
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,320
I wouldn't be alive today.

199
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,400
I grew up in the dance house.

200
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,930
Since young, I had to suffer
countless hardships

201
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,590
and endur countless beatings

202
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,930
to become the top dancer in the house.

203
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,870
At the same time,
I became my mother's cash cow.

204
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,240
You have to entertain clients.

205
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,840
I despised that life.

206
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,710
But I couldn't change anything.

207
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,030
Just when I had lost all hope

208
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,030
and wished to end my life,

209
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,630
he came.

210
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,880
He was like a beam of light

211
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,270
shining upon me.

212
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,480
Later,

213
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,480
he gave me the dance house

214
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,630
and made me its owner.

215
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,390
He saved you.

216
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,030
Your unwillingness to betray him
even at the cost of your life

217
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,160
is understandable.

218
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,540
At the dance house,

219
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,630
I helped him collect

220
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,830
intelligence on officials and nobles.

221
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,200
You know what?

222
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,870
Everyone saw me as

223
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,970
a lowly dancer.

224
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,600
Only he

225
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,630
never looked down on my background.

226
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,890
Whatever debt you owed him,

227
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,790
it was cleared

228
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,550
the moment he sent someone to kill you.

229
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,390
From now on,

230
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,810
live for yourself.

231
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,720
Live for myself?

232
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,200
Who is this Meng Junran?

233
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,230
Your Eminence told you to listen to him.

234
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,140
You can't possibly not know

235
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
who he is, can you?

236
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,770
I don't know.

237
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,150
Then it seems your subordinates

238
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,130
were right.

239
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,790
Prime Minister Zhuang these days

240
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,520
has been staying in the palace.

241
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,260
So he couldn't have had the chance

242
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,670
to give you orders.

243
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,900
So it must be this Meng Junran.

244
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,550
Tell me his identity.

245
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,240
I can spare your life.

246
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,550
Why?

247
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,040
You don't believe me?

248
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,270
Members of the death camp

249
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,550
never betray.

250
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,550
Because death for them

251
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,630
is an extreme luxury.

252
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,080
Without permission,

253
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,240
taking one's own life

254
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,780
means no reincarnation after death.

255
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,030
When captured by enemies,
to prove loyalty,

256
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,390
only suicide brings release.

257
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,550
You think these little tricks

258
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,790
can fool me?

259
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,910
I truly don't know

260
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,290
Meng Junran's identity

261
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,080
As for the reason

262
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,440
why His Eminence sent us
to complete this mission

263
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,720
or what his plans are,

264
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,630
we're merely following orders.

265
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,520
These are the rules.

266
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,670
People from the death camp

267
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,000
understand rules best.

268
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,600
However,

269
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,600
I have something else

270
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
to tell you.

271
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,240
You'll find it very interesting.

272
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,390
Go on.

273
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,390
Once,

274
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,000
there was a little girl.

275
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
When I first saw her,

276
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,360
she was like a little stray dog.

277
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,630
I only needed one flatbread

278
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,600
to lure her back to

279
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,110
my death camp

280
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,740
All these years,

281
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,750
I often dream of her,

282
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,870
dream of all the moments

283
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,080
we spent together.

284
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,550
She was so tiny.

285
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,360
All covered in blood.

286
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,870
She would kneel down

287
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,200
and kowtow to me saying,

288
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,630
"I'm sorry.

289
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm sorry."

290
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,440
But she

291
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,700
should be grateful to me, shouldn't she?

292
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,320
Without me,

293
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,740
how could she have
such great martial skills now?

294
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,480
People can only

295
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,670
unleash their unlimited potential

296
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,440
when they're close to death.

297
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,000
I would hold her underwater

298
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,270
and then save her.

299
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,440
Breath control.

300
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,270
What a master archer needs most

301
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,329
is breath control.

302
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,369
Without proper breath control and focus,

303
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,849
how could she ever shoot accurately?

304
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,400
How could she become the deadliest arrow?

305
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,440
Then,

306
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,900
I locked her in the cellar.

307
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,440
Do you know

308
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,240
what total darkness is like?

309
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,080
She didn't see the sun for six months.

310
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,720
During those six months,

311
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,300
if a few rats got in,

312
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,110
she would be deeply grateful to me.

313
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,670
There was no sound.

314
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,480
No sound.

315
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,660
Not a single sound.

316
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,820
Your Highness,

317
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,510
do you know who I'm talking about?

318
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,650
You think angering me

319
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,200
will make me kill you?

320
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,830
When it comes to tactics,

321
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,920
you may be even more ruthless

322
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,110
and cruel than I am.

323
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,350
You also know better than anyone

324
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,480
what kind of torture

325
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,400
awaits you.

326
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,480
So you want to end it all,

327
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,750
thinking you can escape the suffering.

328
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,790
You even try to end your life
by biting your tongue off.

329
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,670
But I won't let you have your way.

330
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,270
I'll make you regret

331
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,230
ever being born.

332
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,030
The Junior Marquis of Changle

333
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,720
is His Highness' childhood friend.

334
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,650
They're as close as real brothers.

335
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,610
And the old nursemaid

336
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,440
who'd been with me since I was born.

337
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,700
To win favor with my enemy,

338
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,000
she tried

339
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,270
to burn me alive in my sleep.

340
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,440
Even my childhood study companion

341
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,170
And my swordsmanship teacher…

342
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,350
They all used my trust

343
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,550
and tried every possible way

344
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,960
to kill me.

345
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,750
If you knew that

346
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,510
even your close friend of many years

347
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,510
had betrayed you,

348
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,270
how painful would that be?

349
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,340
Your Highness.

350
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,070
This is the inner palace garden.

351
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,130
Outside officials

352
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,840
are not allowed to enter.

353
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,430
Wait outside with Princess.

354
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,440
I'll go meet the Empress Dowager.

355
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,070
Your Highness,

356
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,070
we've entered the palace.

357
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,350
Instead of greeting the Emperor first,

358
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,070
we are meeting the Empress Dowager?

359
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,240
Let me meet the Empress Dowager with you.

360
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
If she gives you trouble,

361
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,440
I'll explain for you.

362
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,640
It's good for Her Highness to come along.

363
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,720
After all, leaving Susha
without permission

364
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,180
requires an explanation.

365
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,240
I can explain to her clearly

366
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,040
why both of us had to leave Susha.

367
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,680
When we meet the Empress Dowager,

368
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
whatever she asks you,

369
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,000
just answer truthfully.

370
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,730
Don't worry.

371
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,290
[Shunde Palace]

372
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,350
Your Majesty,

373
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,060
the Prince of Zhennan and his wife
have arrived.

374
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,490
You may leave.

375
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,810
I pay my respects, Mother.

376
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,400
Rise.

377
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,170
Thank you, Mother.

378
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,270
So this is your new wife,

379
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,850
the Princess of Susha?

380
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,680
Since the Emperor promised Susha

381
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,680
that you would be their son-in-law,

382
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,210
why did you disobey
and return to the capital?

383
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,320
You even brought

384
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,080
the Princess of Susha with you.

385
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,920
Our countries have just made peace.

386
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,650
Are you trying to provoke a war?

387
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,550
As the Commander-in-Chief of Zhennan Pass,

388
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,270
if I were detained in Susha indefinitely,

389
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,070
I fear the Zhennan Army

390
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,270
would lose morale and fighting spirit.

391
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,590
I risked my life to return

392
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,650
was all for Jinxiu,

393
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,370
So you're saying

394
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,350
that sending you to Susha as a son-in-law

395
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,070
was a mistake by the Emperor and me?

396
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,710
Mother,

397
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,390
I never meant that.

398
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,460
You've grown bolder

399
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,680
and making your own decisions now.

400
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,440
You dare to disobey

401
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,770
both me and the Emperor.

402
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,130
I wouldn't dare.

403
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,590
I wouldn't dare to defy

404
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,790
your or His Majesty's wishes in any way.

405
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,830
Please understand, Your Highness.

406
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,830
All these years the Prince of Zhennan
spent in Pingling City,

407
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,680
he dedicated every thought

408
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,590
to defending the borders
and protecting the country.

409
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,590
He has no selfish intentions whatsoever.

410
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,830
These words coming

411
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,880
from an enemy princess's mouth.

412
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,570
How can I possibly believe them?

413
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,930
If it weren't true,

414
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,960
I wouldn't have willingly

415
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,440
angered my father and brothers

416
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,200
just to help the Prince of Zhennan

417
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,250
return to Jinxiu.

418
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,030
So you're saying

419
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,030
I should thank you

420
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,430
for your righteousness?

421
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,480
You, leave.

422
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,130
I need to speak

423
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,560
with your husband alone.

424
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,870
Back then, to escape from Jinxiu,

425
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,750
you called me Mother.

426
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,760
Now, to escape from Susha,

427
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,440
you didn't hesitate to bring

428
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,030
that enemy princess with you.

429
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,240
Have you figured out how to explain this

430
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,750
to your Red-Clad General?

431
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,550
What?

432
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,550
You don't actually think

433
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,480
I don't know what you've been doing

434
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,080
in Pingling City, do you?

435
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,480
These years,

436
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,210
you've done well at the border.

437
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,200
Pingling City has been governed

438
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
with perfect order under your rule.

439
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,980
The several invasions from Susha

440
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,440
were also repelled by you.

441
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,290
Now throughout the court,

442
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,550
who doesn't know the reputation
of the Prince of Zhennan?

443
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,510
It's all thanks to your nurturing, Mother.

444
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,030
You also have the blood
of the late emperor.

445
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,720
You're Jinxiu's only Prince.

446
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,410
The Emperor is a carefree man.

447
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,790
Jinxiu's grand affairs

448
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,130
shall rely on you in the future.

449
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Don't let

450
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,240
my nurturing go to waste.

451
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,470
Has someone wronged you?

452
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,010
Tell me who bullied you.

453
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,840
I'll make them regret it.

454
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,640
Remember,

455
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,800
after you're married,
no matter what happens,

456
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,520
you must let Father know.

457
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,230
I'll always be your support.

458
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,860
The entire Susha

459
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,180
is your backing.

460
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,800
♪ Roaming freely ♪

461
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,720

463
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,940

00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,610
I can accept anything.

465
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,240
Because more than anyone else

466
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,200
in this world,

467
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,390

468
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,030

Dare to not kneel before His Majesty?

474
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,220
Who are you?

475
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,330
Raise your head.

476
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,910
Your Majesty.

477
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,720
This is the wife of the Prince of Zhennan.

478
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,850
Xiyang pays respects to Your Majesty.

479
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,310
Well, well,

480
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,420
Xia Jingshi has returned.

481
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,310
You have the nerve to come back?

482
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,790
Stop!

483
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,000
Stop!

484
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,600
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

485
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,040
Your Majesty.

486
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,700
What are you doing?

487
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,230
I'm going to kill him.

488
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,070
Your Majesty!

489
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,830
You absolutely cannot!

490
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,400
You must not!

491
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,330
Get out of my way!

492
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,300
Enough!

493
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,640
Stop this nonsense.

494
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,800
Your brother has just returned

495
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,110
and you're already threatening
to kill him.

496
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,070
How would this look if word got out?

497
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,350
If he has done something wrong,

498
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,150
you should address it properly.

499
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,790
Let him admit the wrongs himself.

500
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,110
The royal family's dignity

501
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,240
has been completely disgraced by you.

502
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:14,920
Mother.

503
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,720
I made my own decision

504
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,200
to leave Susha without permission

505
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,750
because I was forced by circumstances.

506
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,550
I couldn't report to you in time.

507
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,030
But everything I've done

508
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,030
was for Jinxiu,

509
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,310
and for Your Majesty.

510
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,480
I had no selfish intentions.

511
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,730
Stop pretending.

512
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,830
A lowborn like you

513
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,720
dares to stand before Mother

514
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,180
and call yourself her son?

515
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,210
Let me tell you,

516
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,910
killing you now

517
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,900
would be like crushing an ant.

518
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,310
Enough of this.

519
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,590
Prince of Zhennan, you've come from afar.

520
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,350
I assume you haven't arranged

521
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,590
your accommodations yet.

522
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,570
In my opinion,

523
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,800
he should stay at the Rongyang Palace
in the north.

524
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,550
Bai Shouzhuo,

525
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,890
escort them there.

526
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

527
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,820
Please follow me, both of you.

528
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

529
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,090
Mother,

530
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,910
I shall take my leave now.

531
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,480
Please.

532
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Prime Minister.

533
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,880
Minister Hou has been seriously wounded
in an assassination attempt.

534
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,590
The Ministry of War is now leaderless

535
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,750
and is in complete disarray.

536
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,030
What should we do?

537
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,880
Prime Minister Zhuang.

538
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,110
The most urgent matter now

539
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,920
is to immediately select an official

540
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,390
to replace the Minister.

541
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,630
Censor Wang,

542
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,940
who do you have in mind?

543
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,790
Liu Qin, the Vice Minister of War.

544
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,680
He has served as Deputy Minister
for over five years

545
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,270
without making any mistakes.

546
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,070
Having him replace the Minister

547
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,770
would be most appropriate.

548
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,050
I recommend the official
from the Minister of War,

549
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,150
Zhao Zhongxian.

550
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,480
Lord Zhao is well-versed in state affairs,

551
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,510
skilled in both civil
and military matters.

552
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,720
Your Majesty has praised him many times.

553
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,780
He is truly a talent worth employing.

554
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,150
Lord Zhao is indeed talented,

555
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,560
but he is quite young.

556
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,960
If we appoint him as the Minister,

557
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,310
I fear others may not accept
his authority.

558
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,960
How about Minister Li Rongshi
from the Ministry of Works?

559
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,010
He could transfer from Works to War.

560
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,310
That would be acceptable.

561
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,200
Indeed, Minister Li would be
more suitable.

562
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,680
But Deputy Minister Liu is more familiar

563
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,030
with the affairs of the Ministry of War.

564
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,600
I have heard

565
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,850
what you all said.

566
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,990
I need to think carefully

567
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,840
about these three candidates.

568
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,030
Father.

569
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,960
Whether it's Left Vice Minister Liu Qin,

570
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,610
physician Zhao Zhongxian,

571
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,910
or Li Rongshi,

572
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,360
they are all our people.

573
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,740
How is His Majesty?

574
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,590
I don't know when

575
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,450
he will wake up.

576
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,590
You ordered him back

577
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,920
just to kill him?

578
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,540
I don't care.

579
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,680
I feel disgusted just looking at him.

580
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,140
I want to kill him on sight.

581
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,270
Anyway, Mother

582
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,350
won't let me actually do it,

583
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:24,920
right?

584
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,790
Stop causing me trouble.

585
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,790
He now commands

586
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,990
over 100,000 troops.

587
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,660
If anything happens to him,

588
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,790
the army from Pingling City

589
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,920
will storm the capital.

590
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,960
I should have killed

591
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,790
that bastard back then.

592
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,710
It was you.

593
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,110
You were bewitched by his constant calls

594
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,480
of 'Mother' and lost all senses.

595
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,160
You insisted on letting him go.

596
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,090
All these years,

597
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,750
he's been fighting wars and gaining merit.

598
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,640
I've been mocked

599
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,500
as just a capital-bound emperor.

600
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,610
Now you fear him

601
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,200
and think I'm causing you trouble?

602
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,070
He is a bastard.

603
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,350
You are my true son.

604
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,400
But you are incompetent!

605
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:57,880
I...

606
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,260
If you want to secure your throne,

607
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,920
if you want to spend your days
in debauchery

608
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,960
and do whatever you please,

609
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,800
you must rely on Xia Jingshi.

610
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,930
With him here,

611
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,680
Zhennan Pass will remain secure.

612
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
Those old ministers at court

613
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,260
won't dare to make trouble.

614
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,080
He does have the ability,

615
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,030
but he lacks loyalty.

616
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,280
He may look like a dog now,

617
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,030
but did you see

618
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,510
that look in his eyes just now?

619
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,930
He's a wolf cub.

620
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,710
He will bite sooner or later.

621
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
I naturally have ways to control him

622
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,030
and make him bow

623
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,400
to us, mother and son.

624
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
This way, please.

[Rongyang Palace]

626
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,790
This place is different
from other palace gardens.

627
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,070
It's where palace eunuchs

628
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,670
recover before their death.

629
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,920
Ordinary people are not allowed here,

630
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,050
hence it's guarded.

631
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,590
Xia Jingyan deliberately humiliates

632
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,480
Your Highness.

633
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,510
Shut up.

634
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,750
But this place has been uninhabited
for years.

635
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,410
My lady, please don't mind it.

636
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,170
Your Highness.

637
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,480
Please.

638
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,530
Be careful, Your Highness.

639
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,880
Are you alright, Your Highness?

640
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,590
Did you twist your ankle?

641
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,450
My foot is fine.

642
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,090
I was just careless.

643
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,880
How can they let His Highness

644
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,280
stay in a place like this?

645
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,510
I'm afraid there isn't even

646
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,000
a clean table or chair.

647
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,390
Don't worry, Your Highness.

648
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,110
Our conditions in the military

649
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,710
were much harsher than this.

650
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,720
You needn't worry about His Highness.

651
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,000
He's just going in to see

652
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,350
if it has been tidied up yet.

653
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,680
We'll wait for him here.

654
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,080
Your Highness, please sit.

655
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,740
Your Highness.

656
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,350
Shouzhe has finally waited

657
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,360
for your return.

658
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,550
Looking at his condition,

659
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,730
I fear he won't last through the night.

660
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,730
Who can blame him?

661
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,480
He broke Her Majesty's

662
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,550
favorite vase.

663
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,370
All these years,

664
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,969
you've suffered much.

665
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,320
Please rise.

666
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,730
I didn't suffer.

667
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,320
I am now

00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,470
the Emperor's head eunuch.

669
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,230
I can act freely. No one dares to stop me.

670
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,440
If Your Highness has any requests,

671
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,100
please don't hesitate to ask.

672
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,670
Following your instructions,

673
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,510
I didn't accompany Your Highness

674
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,630
to Pingling.

675
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,400
Every day I've been here,

676
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,110
I've been waiting

677
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,190
for your return.

678
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,400
During these years I've been away
from the capital,

679
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,400
there were indeed many matters

680
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,200
that required your assistance.

681
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,250
But you must be extremely careful.

682
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,880
Xia Jingyan is cunning and ruthless.

683
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:25,960
We absolutely cannot let him

684
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,020
suspect anything.

685
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,870
I understand.

686
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,000
Since learning of your return,

687
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,320
I've copied these documents

688
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,430
and kept them ready.

689
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,960

I've been

699
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,880
a pampered prince since childhood.

700
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,550
I've never led troops nor fought in battle.

701
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,280
His Majesty has passed the command

702
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,320
of the Imperial Guards to me.

703
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,980
Isn't that asking for my life?

704
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,170

if a few rats had gotten in,

You're considered to be
from a military family.

How hard can it be
for you to lead the Imperial Guards?

You're used to it.

718
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,880

but Mr. Ma won't allow it.

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,710
I'm afraid our Imperial Guards

to oppose me?

756
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,520
I wouldn't dare.

757
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,730
However,

758
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,840
I must ensure

759
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,600
Lord Ling remains unharmed.

760
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,040
Only if he's safe

761
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,680
can His Majesty be saved.

762
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,230
What are you doing?

763
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:11,890
Step aside.

764
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,640
What's the meaning of this?

765
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,590
How does it feel to have a knife

766
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,480
at your throat?

767
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,620
Making such jokes in the imperial palace

768
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,630
seems inappropriate, doesn't it?

769
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,110
In the imperial palace,

770
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,720
who are you to tell me what to do?

771
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:41,880
I merely want

772
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,680
to ask Lord Ling some questions.

773
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,760
This matter doesn't concern you.

774
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,440
I brought him here

775
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,630
to treat His Majesty.

776
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,360
Anyone who dares to trouble him

777
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,070
is opposing me.

778
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,050
Your Highness, please calm down.

779
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,280
It's because Lord Ling

780
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,590
refuses to disclose

781
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,710
His Majesty's condition.

782
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,820
I've examined His Majesty's

783
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,840
recent medication records

784
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,520
and found the prescribed medicines
quite strange.

785
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,670
What's strange about them?

786
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,550
Speak clearly.

787
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,610
The medicines recorded

788
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,020
are all for treating mental exhaustion.

789
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,510
If His Majesty's illness

790
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,590
were caused by mental fatigue,

791
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,880
he certainly wouldn't

792
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,110
remain unconscious for so long.

793
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,760
Moreover,

794
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,360
with Lord Ling's medical skills,

795
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,810
he should have already

796
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,480
awakened His Majesty by now.

797
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,920
Besides Mr. Ma,

798
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,510
the last person His Majesty saw

799
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,570
before falling unconscious was you.

800
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,840
Shortly after that,

801
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,360
you brought Lord Ling into the palace.

802
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,190
He took over all matters

803
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,250
regarding His Majesty's treatment.

804
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,670
Yet His Majesty remains unconscious
for days.

805
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,070
Now the entire court is asking me

806
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,250
what happened to His Majesty.

807
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,640
First Prince,

808
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,230
tell me,

809
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,880
how should I answer them?

810
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,690
Zhuang Shen,

811
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,750
what are you implying?

812
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,550
I'm merely stating facts.

813
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,630
Lord Ling,

814
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,330
why are you so nervous?

815
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,960
Are you feeling guilty?

816
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,280
I don't usually see anyone at court

817
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,410
care so much about His Majesty before.

818
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,110
If anyone has questions,

819
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,910
let them ask me directly.

820
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,170
You're known as the Killer God.

821
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,310
Who would dare question you?

822
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,960
Are you all so eager to know

823
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,820
what illness Feng Pingcheng has?

824
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,810
Absolutely not!

825
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,590
Absolutely not,

826
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,280
Lord Ling!

827
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,970
He has a terminal illness.

828
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,890
It's incurable.

829
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,520
Even gods couldn't save him.

830
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,800
Last March,

831
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,400
May the year before,

832
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,920
October three years ago...

833
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,460
I've lost count.

834
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,550
If I hadn't been keeping him alive,

835
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,080
he would have died long ago!

836
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,840
Lord Ling.

837
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,450
You...

838
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,610
I'll say what I want.

839
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,070
I don't owe you anything.

840
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,710
Find whoever you want to treat him.

841
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,650
I'm done with this.

842
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,110
If anyone reveals

843
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,570
what was discussed today,

844
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,480
I will exterminate their entire family.

845
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,000
Yes.

846
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,030
Lord Ling.

847
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,150
[Ning'an Hall]

848
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,840
Those things you just said

849
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,580
were just to fool them, right?

850
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,630
All that talk about terminal illness

851
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,960
was just to frighten them.

852
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,760
Isn't that so?

853
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,350
Impossible.

854
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,800
What illness can't you cure?

855
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,030
You're the master of Zhengnian Villa,

856
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,630
the best doctor in the world.

857
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,670
Even if others can't cure him,

858
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,150
you must have a way to save him.

859
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,080
Unfortunately, I'm just a mortal,

860
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,670
not a god.

861
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,250
When was the illness discovered?

862
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,420
Fifteen years ago.

863
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,000
Fifteen?

864
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,090
He knew about his terminal illness

865
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,350
fifteen years ago.

866
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,560
That's right.

867
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:09,760
One could say

868
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,960
that every day for these fifteen years,

869
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,070
your father has been living

870
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,000
on the edge between life and death.

871
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,130
Why didn't he tell me?

872
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,990
You were still young then,

873
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,400
and you resented him

874
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,800
for your mother's death.

875
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,330
He chose not to tell you.

876
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,480
He must have had his reasons.

877
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,510
I deliberately let Zhuang Shen and others
know

878
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,630
for your own good.

879
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,840
Otherwise they would definitely

880
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,000
blame all of your father's illness

881
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,150
on you.

882
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,590
Your situation will be

883
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,520
even worse then.

884
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,790
What can I do?

885
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,930
Is there any way to cure him?

886
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,550
I don't even know

887
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,630
what I should do.

888
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,030
All these years, I've traveled everywhere

889
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,920
trying to find a way to save your father.

890
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,590
That's because

891
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,630
I promised your mother

892
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,800
to save him.

893
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,740
It has nothing to do with Feng Pingcheng.

894
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,140
Even though your mother has passed away,

895
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,250
I would still do my best.

896
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,880
But human ability has its limits,

897
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,280
and fate has its course.

898
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,410
I can only barely extend his life.

899
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,960
I cannot find a way to save him.

900
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,590
What about the place that saved Ning Fei?

901
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,630
Does that place have a way to cure him?

902
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,440
That place

903
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,800
is the Storm Alliance

904
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,130
founded by your mother.

905
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,130
Mother?

906
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:17,960
The people of the Storm Alliance

907
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,000
hate Feng Pingcheng deeply

908
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,590
because of your mother's death.

909
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,230
Would they be willing to save him?

910
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,550
Besides, your father is suffering from

911
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,810
qi depletion illness.

912
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,800
Even if they were willing to help,

913
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,130
they couldn't save him.

914
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,190
Lord Ling.

915
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,160
I just learned this truth today.

916
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,640
But I beg you.

917
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,380
His Majesty needs you now.

918
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,310
Please also fulfill the promise

919
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,320
you made to Mother.

920
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,710
As for those who doubt you,

921
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:43,640
leave them to me.

922
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,460
Please feel free to treat him.

923
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,510
Consider this a personal plea from me.
