[Fated Hearts]

2
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,950
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,479
Zhuang Shen attempted to

4
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,150
have Feng Suige assassinated
in the street,

5
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,479
which ended in failure.

6
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,120
Feng Suige then broke into
the Zhuang Residence,

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,380
captured Zhuang Shen,

8
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,479
and took him to the imperial palace.

9
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,590
Zhuang Shen could be said

10
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,250
as a relative of yours, right?

11
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,690
My brother once told me

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,790
Zhuang Shen was responsible
for our mother's death.

13
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,250
That explains the enmity.

14
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
Feng Suige killed Zhuang Shen
in the Susha imperial palace,

15
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,750
in the presence of all.

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,810
Then, the Zhuang family's property
was ordered to be confiscated.

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,970
A powerful official was convicted

18
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,800
of treason within just one day.

19
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,470
Your brother was said to be
decisive and resolute.

20
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,930
Indeed, how crafty of him.

21
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,870
The next morning,

22
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,940
Feng Suige slayed the Emperor

23
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,490
alone with a sword,

24
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,970
planning to usurp the throne.

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,560
Give it to me! I'll read it myself!

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,820
Feng Suige's atrocity

27
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,130
was finally revealed.

28
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,290
Murong Zhong and Murong Yao
executed him in the end.

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,870
Are the investigators
you sent out for this matter

30
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,590
reliable?

31
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,750
What?

32
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,870
You still don't believe it?

33
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,310
Murong Yao

34
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,970
was my brother's best friend.

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,470
Murong Zhong

36
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,820
was like an uncle to us,
as he watched us grow up.

37
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,560
My brother was even closer to him

38
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,620
than to our father!

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,430
How could they have

40
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,030
possibly killed my brother?

41
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,190
Are there raging flames of fury

42
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,670
in your heart now,

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,310
amidst the confusion

44
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,590
about who you should hate

45
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,790
and who you should direct your anger to?

46
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,150
I said it right, didn't I?

47
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,600
Oh, you.

48
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,760
How foolish!

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,560
Why not just vent out

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,890
the anger in your heart?

51
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,000
Since you have no idea

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,190
who you should take revenge on,

53
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,680
just kill whoever you want!

54
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
If you kill the wrong person, so be it.

55
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,590
It's better than restraining yourself,
isn it?

56
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,150
Can you find out

57
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,410
who my enemy really is?

58
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,480
One more investigation?

59
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,840
Isn't everything

60
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,470
written clearly in this report?

61
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,910
It was Murong Zhong and his son

62
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,310
who killed your father and brother.

63
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,840
What more evidence do you need?

64
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,400
Why care about if there are hidden truths?

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,600
All will be over when I kill them for you!

66
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,870
Your father already died.

67
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,590
So did your brother.

68
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,040
[Feng Suige's atrocity
was finally revealed]

69
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,590
[Murong Zhong and Murong Yao
executed him in the end]

70
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,360
They were killed
by Murong Zhong and his son.

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,960
See for yourself!

72
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,210
That's the spirit.

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,390
I'm telling you, from now on,

74
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,080
I disallow you to restrain yourself again.

75
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,750
Life is about

76
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,150
doing whatever you want.

77
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,310
Curse whoever you want!

78
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,490
Kill whoever you want!

79
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,800
That's the way to please yourself!

80
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,400
Get out!

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,970
Get out of here!

82
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,410
-Feng Xiyang!
-Get out!

83
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,800
Scram!

84
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,930
Feng Xiyang, you...

85
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,360
You...

86
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,200
Have some more

87
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,920
snacks and cakes delivered

88
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,070
to Prince Xiyang.

89
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,530
Make them look pretty.

90
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,720
That might cheer her up.

91
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,950
What are you waiting for?

92
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,750
Go get it done!

93
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,750
Yes.

94
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
Our biggest concern

95
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,400
has become reality.

96
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,950
His eyes are cured
with Lady An's treatment,

97
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,870
indicating that the blood clots
in his brain have resolved.

98
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,870
That's good news.

99
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,630
I thought the worst scenario would be

100
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,159
he losing all the memories,

101
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,430
but the real situation
is unexpectedly worse.

102
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,090
He does remember some things.

103
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,270
But he thinks of you as an enemy,

104
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,360
forgetting all the good things about you.

105
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,159
Is it possible

106
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,330
to help him recover all the memories?

107
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,190
You heard what Lady An said, didn't you?

108
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,270
The brain

109
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,770
is incredibly intricate.

110
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,160
No one can tell if he can

111
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,760
recollect all the memories.

112
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,260
Enough.

113
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,770
Let's not leave it to fate.

114
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,030
Miss Yixiao,

115
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,230
don't worry too much.

116
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,510
When His Highness wakes up,

117
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,270
I'll tell him everything,

118
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,510
even if I have to pin him down.

119
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,970
Great. That's a good idea.

120
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,920
See,

121
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,390
you know best about their story.

122
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,800
Yeah.

123
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,750
Telling it to him in detail

124
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,750
will help to jog his memory.

125
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,280
Exactly!

126
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,920
Kiddo,

127
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,630
Lu Ke is right.

128
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,600
Just don't worry.

129
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,120
Suige's mind is a mess now.

130
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,800
Whatever he says or does,

131
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,600
don't take it to heart.

132
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,480
I'm fine.

133
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,720
Don't worry.

134
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,490
I'm mentally prepared.

135
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,360
At least,

136
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,050
his life has been saved.

137
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,430
At least,

138
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,270
he can see now.

139
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,070
At least,

140
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,310
unlike me in the past,

141
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,600
he still knows who he is.

142
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,830
Alright.

143
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Say no more.

144
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
I'll go talk to Lady An.

145
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,700
I'll beg her to work out a plan.

146
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,920
I heard

147
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,510
Feng Suige had come to.

148
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,909
He did wake up from a coma,

149
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,480
but his condition is complex.

150
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,610
I'll go find Lady An.

151
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,310
Today, I'm here

152
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,830
to deliver you a message.

153
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,720
I've made some inquiries.

154
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,250
Rumor has it in Yujing City

155
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,390
that Feng Suige killed the Emperor

156
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,830
and was then executed by the Murong family

157
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,160
in the name of defending the sovereignty.

158
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,270
That is to say,

159
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,000
nobody but us knows

160
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,700
Feng Suige is still alive.

161
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,140
The Second Prince of Susha

162
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,540
has already ascended the throne.

163
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,350
[In Storm Alliance on Wufeng Mountain]

164
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,100
Your Highness,

165
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,490
you finally woke up!

166
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,510
I meant it when I said I could wake him up

167
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,800
by putting a needle in only one acupoint.

168
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Impressive.

169
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,250
How are you feeling?

170
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,570
Do you remember who I am?

171
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,420
What about him?

172
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,510
You're Lord Ling.

173
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,000
He is Lu Ke.

174
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,950
Terrific.

175
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,289
What's going on with me?

176
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,549
Where am I?

177
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,670
I can't explain to you

178
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,870
the whole thing right now.

179
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,870
Just remember this:

180
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,600
you escaped death not long ago.

181
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,790
You need a good rest now.

182
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,030
Don't ask any questions.

183
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,720
Lu Ke,

184
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,500
have we conquered Pingling City yet?

185
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,630
What?

186
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,440
Please try thinking of a way

187
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,630
to help him recover

188
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,630
more memories.

189
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,000
What do you mean?

190
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,800
What are you talking about?

191
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,600
Try figuring out a way, please.

192
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,440
Yeah.

193
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,910
But I...

194
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,910
Fu Yixiao...

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
I'm going to kill you!

196
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,130
No, no!

197
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,600
Calm down.

198
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,910
Calm down, Your Highness.

199
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,110
-Listen to me...
-You have to leave now!

200
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,270
You need a good rest now.

201
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,490
Get some rest!

202
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,360
See?

203
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,630
Calm down.

204
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,790
Are you alright, Your Highness?

205
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,840
Take a breath.

206
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Stay calm.

207
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,080
Let's go.

208
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,320
Move it!

209
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,810
I know you're hurting inside.

210
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,550
If you're really that upset,

211
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,670
cry it out.

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,530
It'll make you feel better.

213
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,200
How can anyone take this?

214
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,150
A once

215
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
loving couple

216
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,670
has become

217
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,840
mortal enemies.

218
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,030
You're saying

219
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,790
she's my dearest and beloved one?

220
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,990
How is that possible?

221
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,940
Your Highness,

222
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,440
why would I ever lie to you?

223
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,880
She really is. You've just forgotten that.

224
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,080
Due to severe physical trauma

225
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,530
and prolonged suffocation,

226
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,960
there were blood clots in your brain,

227
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,560
which caused you blindness.

228
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,200
Lady An made the clots go away

229
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,320
and fixed your eyes

230
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,020
with the Golden Acupuncture.

231
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,010
But meanwhile,

232
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,720
you lost some memories,

233
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,200
and your mind was disturbed.

234
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,630
That's why when you saw Fu Yixiao,

235
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,120
you behaved
completely different than usual,

236
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,920
and felt irritable, agitated,
and out of control.

237
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,940
Then how do you explain this scar?

238
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,010
When she shot an arrow at me,

239
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,750
she clearly meant to kill me!

240
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
This is an attack

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,120
I will never forget.

242
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
That arrow attack

243
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,600
is the most indelible memory in his mind?

244
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,360
Exactly.

245
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,270
I guess that's the reason.

246
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
He can't remember

247
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,080
what happened
after the Battle of Pingling,

248
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,960
when you shot that arrow

249
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,840
at him.

250
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,160
Nonetheless,

251
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,240
perhaps this is destiny.

252
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,600
If it weren't for this arrow

253
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,870
that changed you two's lives,

254
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,630
he might've

255
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,030
forgotten everything by now,

256
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,120
and the situation would've become worse.

257
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,000
If he had lost all the memories,

258
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,390
it would be even harder

259
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,790
for him to recover them.

260
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,240
I've seen

261
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,610
many similar cases.

262
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,630
He'd be too stubborn

263
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,580
to take anyone's advice

264
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,080
or to trust anyone.

265
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,270
How can you even not

266
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,270
believe my words?

267
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,160
How am I supposed to believe all of this?

268
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,790
If it's really as you say—

269
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,640
that I've lost memories,

270
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,120
then what should I do

271
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,320
to get them back?

272
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,090
You must leave him.

273
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,390
All you can do now

274
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,960
is leave him.

275
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,200
You have to disappear from his life,

276
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,440
and to never see him again.

277
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,270
Don't show your face either.

278
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,370
Just let him gradually forget you.

279
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,480
Give him time

280
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,000
for a full recovery.

281
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,320
Can you do that?

282
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,390
Well...

283
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,670
How long do I need to wait?

284
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,040
Three or five years.

285
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,200
Maybe a decade.

286
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,000
It could also be a lifetime.

287
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,320
There's nothing

288
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,980
we can say to convince you now.

289
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,750
Forget it.

290
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,690
We can't rush anything.

291
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,750
Listen,

292
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,870
just focus on recuperating.

293
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,790
When you recover,

294
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,450
we'll resume the discussion.

295
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,910
I want to meet with Fu Yixiao.

296
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,440
What?

297
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,750
Why meet with her?

298
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,350
Do you still want to kill her?

299
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,200
I want to know the truth.

300
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,870
Fine. The truth is as follows.

301
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,790
In order to save your life,

302
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,480
Fu Yixiao gathered us

303
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
and went to a lot of trouble

304
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,840
in the past many days.

305
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,240
I'm telling you,

306
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,150
only when you recall who she really is

307
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,070
can you go meet her.

308
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,480
Otherwise, just don't see her again.

309
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,550
If it takes you a lifetime
to figure it out,

310
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,680
then stay away from her for a lifetime!

311
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,320
How long do you mean

312
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,150
by "a lifetime"?

313
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,910
Don't you understand?

314
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,510
Sometimes it's better not to see

315
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,910
or have feelings for someone.

316
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,120
Your affection for him

317
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,360
is like a sword.

318
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,670
The closer you are to him,
the deeper the sword sticks into him.

319
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,240
When your wishes are all fulfilled,

320
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,770
he'll be covered in wounds.

321
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,020
But if I leave him...

322
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,790
You'll feel physically
and emotionally hurt,

323
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,450
while he'll be safe and sound.

324
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,960
Emperor.

325
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,060
What are you doing?

326
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,510
Picking flowers.

327
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,080
Can't you see that, Mother?

328
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Picking flowers?

329
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
What else can I do?

330
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,960
The weather is nice today.

331
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,270
Can't I take a walk outside?

332
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,070
Aren't you out here too, Mother?

333
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,610
You could've asked others

334
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,450
to pick the flowers you liked.

335
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,870
How can you do it yourself?

336
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,200
Mother,

337
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,000
it never occurred to me

338
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,060
until this very day

339
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
that some flowers

340
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,790
must be picked by myself,

341
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,190
or there wouldn't be fun.

342
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,600
Some flowers may look gorgeous,

343
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,550
but they wither quickly.

344
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,030
When that happens,

345
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,360
their colors will fade,

346
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,280
leaving only poisonous thorns behind.

347
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,890
It hurts to be pricked.

348
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,600
I've long grown accustomed

349
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,910
to thornless flowers.

350
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,430
It feels nice...

351
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,480
to be pricked.

352
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,190
I've warned you

353
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,510
not to go rogue

354
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,390
or to hit on Feng Xiyang.

355
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,450
Go rogue?

356
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,640
It's true that you're my mother,

357
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,400
but I am the Emperor!

358
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,290
I know exactly what I'm doing.

359
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,800
You grew with the tree,
sharing the same roots.

360
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,790
But eventually,

361
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,090
you would detach from the tree.

362
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,260
As it thrives and flourishes,

363
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,870
you would travel far away.

364
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,030
Perhaps

365
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,400
this is the fate

366
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,660
I can't escape either.

367
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,510
All you can do now

368
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,089
is leave him.

369
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,640
You have to disappear from his life,

370
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,060
and to never see him again.

371
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,150
♪ The rain drifts endlessly ♪

372
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,190

376
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,870

377
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,310
Can you do that?

378
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,080

379
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,780

Miss Yixiao.

402
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,350
I tried explaining
to His Highness just now,

403
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,610
but he wouldn't listen

404
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,240
and he drove me away.

405
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,680
He's still

406
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,880
quite weak right now.

407
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,800
He has probably fallen asleep.

408
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm still worried about him.

409
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
Does he recall
what happened to his father?

410
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,750
He can't remember anything that happened

411
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,410
after the Battle of Pingling.

412
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,640
He's forgotten the most painful memories.

413
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,440
I wonder

414
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,890
if it's a blessing in disguise.

415
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,720
Don't worry too much,

416
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,450
Miss Yixiao.

417
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,640
Elder Zhou and Lord Ling

418
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,770
are now considering

419
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,680
if there are better ways

420
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,000
to jog His Highness's memory.

421
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,110
If we're out of options,

422
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll spill everything

423
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,070
at the risk of infuriating His Highness.

424
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,920
Don't do that.

425
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,920
He needs to rest now,

426
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,890
since he's weak.

427
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,000
Just tell him

428
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,790
Fu Yixiao has left.

429
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,310
But...

430
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,640
This is the best solution now.

431
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,040
It helps him recuperate.

432
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,430
There's one more option.

433
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,430
Maybe we can give it a try.

434
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,020
Your Highness,

435
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,270
given the poor blood flow in your legs,

436
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,070
you should soak your feet
in warm water more often.

437
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,610
Let me help you!

438
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,790
It's just to bathe your feet.

439
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,490
Why are you acting like a sulky housewife?

440
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,240
It's much more comfortable barefoot.

441
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,350
You should take your shoes off too.

442
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,150
Take them off.

443
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,040
Alright. I can do it myself.

444
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,670
You just fell into the water,

445
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,070
yet you are

446
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,930
acting like a sulking housewife.

447
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,550
Remember to put

448
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,790
plenty of spices on the roast meat.

449
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,200
You like spicy food, don't you?

450
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,600
The spicier, the better.

451
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,920
Besides spicy food,
you also enjoy drinking.

452
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,160
Aside from garlic,

453
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,640
you're not picky at all.

454
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,080
Here you are.

455
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,200
Isn't it too spicy to be put in my mouth?

456
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,130
I'll eat it then.

457
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,070
I see in no one but you

458
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,920
the quality of a wolf,

459
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,500
just like that in myself.

460
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,450
Your Highness,

461
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,770
I want you to have this.

462
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,400
It symbolizes we'll stick together

463
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,800
for the rest of our lives.

464
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,200
This is the first time

465
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,860
I have ever given a gift to a woman.

466
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,400
You cannot refuse it.

467
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,560
have you ever thought about

468
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,580
what kind of man you want to marry?

469
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,550
What's this stuff?

470
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,960
A little wolf.

471
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,750
I'll get Elder Zhou here

472
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,610
to check on you.

473
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,750
What do you need him for?

474
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,410
He can't make wolf figurines.

475
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,480
Your Majesty,

476
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,360
Feng Pingcheng is dead.

477
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
The Murong family has yielded real power.

478
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,310
The rule of the new Emperor of Susha
is yet to be consolidated.

479
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,960
Besides,

480
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,710
with Feng Suige's death,

481
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
the Susha Army has been left leaderless.

482
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,550
I suggest we send troops

483
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,490
straight to Yujing now.

484
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,910
Your Majesty,

485
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,660
at present,

486
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,640
Jinxiu has a marriage alliance with Susha.

487
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,590
The Princess of Susha
is still in Shengjing.

488
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,880
If we declare war on them now,

489
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,240
all our previous efforts,

490
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,550
including
the Prince of Zhennan's marriage,

491
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,960
will be in vain.

492
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,370
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

493
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,110
What now?

494
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,310
Since when do you take interest in
major affairs concerning the state

495
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,110
and the military,
Minister of Imperial Stables?

496
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,720
Now that Her Majesty has summoned

497
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,270
us officials for consultations,

498
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,640
I have no reason to hold back my opinions.

499
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,230
What's more, if you are to start a war,

500
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
won't you need the assistance
of the Imperial Stables?

501
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,130
Stop bickering.

502
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,830
Wang Encheng,

503
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,880
answer me.

504
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,920
What strategy

505
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,740
do you have in mind for conquering Susha?

506
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,150
Your Majesty,

507
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,200
Jinxiu and Susha

508
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,670
have been fighting each other for years.

509
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,720
Our troops are well-trained

510
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,000
with sufficient supplies.

511
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,440
So, it's not hard
to mobilize the entire army.

512
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,240
There is also a general

513
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
standing ready for a war—

514
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,030
the Prince of Zhennan.

515
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,270
All that talking just proves

516
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,790
you're trying to
have the Prince of Zhennan

517
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,110
relocated to Pingling again!

518
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,480
The Prince of Zhennan spent many years

519
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,810
stationing at Pingling

520
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,860
and defending Jinxiu's borders.

521
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,510
What's wrong with recommending

522
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,030
His Highness lead the troops?

523
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,830
Your Majesty,

524
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,750
the Prince of Zhennan was appointed
to marry the Princess of Susha,

525
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,350
but he fled and came back
without permission.

526
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,960
This matter hasn't been settled yet.

527
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,550
If he is designated as the commander,

528
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,750
I'm afraid
people won't accept his authority.

529
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,510
You're only doing this

530
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,750
to give everyone a hard time!

531
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,950
This is pure slander!

532
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,420
Enough!

533
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,720
No more squabbling.

534
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,240
Attacking Susha

535
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,640
is a serious issue.

536
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,100
Let's discuss it another day.

537
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,510
Yes.

538
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,720
You may leave.

539
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,500
All these political disputes

540
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,350
can't be easily settled.

541
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,720
The Emperor and I
don't see eye to eye now.

542
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,440
The most urgent task

543
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,070
is to gain control of Xia Jingshi.

544
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,400
His help is needed to stabilize the court.

545
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,400
God knows when that old punk

546
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,590
Wang Encheng latched onto

547
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,850
the Prince of Zhennan.

548
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,640
He tried to persuade the Empress Dowager

549
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,550
to let the prince return to Pingling

550
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,280
and lead troops against Susha.

551
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,090
Where is Bai Shouzhuo?

552
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,510
Where is he?

553
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,140
You dare not look at me.

554
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,590
Why?

555
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,060
This humble servant dares not offend

556
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,840
the Princess of Zhennan.

557
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,810
What Princess of Zhennan?

558
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,960
Princess Xiyang and the Prince of Zhennan

559
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,890
have broken off their engagement.

560
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,240
From now on,

561
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,160
those who dare to
call her Princess of Zhennan

562
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,640
again

563
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,240
will be heavily punished by me!

564
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,790
As

565
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,810
Your Majesty commands.

566
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,400
Alright.

567
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,030
Stop being angry.

568
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,210
Come with me.

569
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,510
I picked some flowers for you.

570
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,070
Take a look.

571
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,600
See if there's any you like.

572
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,920
I like this one.

573
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,510
This one?

574
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,410
This one's no good.

575
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,440
T-Those are better.

576
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,400
You don't like them?

577
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,330
Put it in my hair.

578
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,790
Get out!

579
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,920
Everyone out!

580
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
How odd it is.

581
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,590
This flower

582
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,540
is clearly withered and worn,

583
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,350
yet when placed in your hair,

584
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,440
it looks prettier

585
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,100
than anything I've ever seen.

586
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,810
Were you talking about attacking Susha?

587
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,880
Are you worried about Susha

588
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,960
or Xia Jingshi?

589
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,270
Listen up,

590
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,480
there's no way

591
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,920
I'll let him

592
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,170
out of my sight.

593
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,110
I only care about Susha.

594
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,090
Have you really decided to attack Susha?

595
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Princess of Susha,

596
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,340
you're getting

597
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,960
bolder and bolder.

598
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,640
Pour me a drink.

599
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,500
I can never stay mad at you.

600
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,310
No matter what you do,

601
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,830
as long as I see you,

602
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,350
I'd feel much more cheerful.

603
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,720
Tell me.

604
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,410
What do you want?

605
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,830
Who will lead the Jinxiu army
to attack Susha?

606
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,090
Will it be Xia Jingshi?

607
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,880
He'd love that to happen.

608
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,440
He has colluded with a bunch of officials

609
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,400
and made them lobby the Empress Dowager.

610
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,110
Does he think

611
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,970
I don't know he's behind all that?

612
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,330
I won't give him the satisfaction.

613
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,950
He lives in Rongyang Palace.

614
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,110
How did he get in contact

615
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,370
with those officials?

616
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,750
Settle down.

617
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,750
Clear your mind.

618
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,240
Do as I say.

619
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,590
Relax.

620
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,200
Breathe.

621
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,070
Relax...

622
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,400
Breathe...

623
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,350
This voice...

624
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,140
Why does it sound so familiar?

625
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,240
Greetings, Mother.

626
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,140
Take a seat.

627
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:53,920
This apricot soup

628
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,480
was freshly made today.

629
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,750
Try some.

630
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,110
Ever since I was little, I've always

631
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,990
remembered you like apricot soup, Mother.

632
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,440
What a good son you are,

633
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
for remembering such a tiny detail.

634
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,530
What happened, Mother?

635
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,590
Who has upset you?

636
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,750
It's been a long time

637
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,590
since you married the Princess of Susha.

638
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,160
Mother,

639
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,760
she and I have never
consummated our marriage.

640
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,880
Now,

641
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,640
we're not even husband and wife in name.

642
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,150
Everything that happens

643
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,070
in this palace is no secret to me.

644
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,110
I refrain from saying

645
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,590
certain things
so as to preserve your dignity.

646
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,200
But I'm perfectly aware

647
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,720
that it must make you feel uncomfortable

648
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,720
when she gets closer to the Emperor.

649
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,540
I've met that girl several times.

650
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,830
She's spoiled.

651
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,290
High-maintenance.

652
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,350
You must have suffered quite a lot.

653
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,590
Let me ask you.

654
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,000
What are you going to do with her?

655
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,280
I'm thinking...

656
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,480
since she's not my wife anymore,

657
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,440
maybe we should send her back to Susha.

658
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,090
You fool!

659
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,860
Her father and brother are dead now.

660
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,460
What can she do back in Susha?

661
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,160
She's like this fan.

662
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,510
On hot summer days,

663
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,680
it's of some use.

664
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,270
But once the weather turns cold,

665
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,500
it becomes useless.

666
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,640
I consider you my own child.

667
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,110
You've been upset.

668
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,640
I'll stand up for you..

669
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
What do you think?

670
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,590
Do

671
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,370
as you see fit, Mother.

672
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,830
Xiyang has misplaced her efforts.

673
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,160
Even the Emperor
has been influenced by her.

674
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,960
Don't bother yourself

675
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,270
with matters about her.

676
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,200
Leave them to me.

677
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,750
Also,

678
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,270
there's one more thing

679
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,530
I need to ask you about.

680
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,450
The court of Susha is in chaos now.

681
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,960
This is the perfect timing
to launch an attack.

682
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,560
It's a good opportunity for Jinxiu,

683
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,810
and more so for you.

684
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,160
Would you like to be
a military commander again

685
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,960
and to fight on the battlefield?

686
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,590
I promise

687
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,150
I won't be a disappointment, Mother.

688
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,960
Good.

689
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,510
Mr. Gao!

690
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,200
I am very concerned

691
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,310
about your health.

692
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,270
When you conquer Susha,

693
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,940
I'll find

694
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,560
a good physician for you.

695
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,780
Thank you, Mother.

696
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,570
[IIIII]

697
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,190
[IIIII]

698
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,550
Those lines were carved by Huang.

699
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,920
Lady An,

700
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,590
what brings you here?

701
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,350
This morning, Ling Feng came to see me.

702
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,440
That old man

703
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,530
made a bet with me.

704
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,590
He doesn't believe

705
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,830
I can cure Feng Suige's

706
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,880
amnesia.

707
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,440
He said if Feng Suige could

708
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,550
get all the memories back,

709
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,270
he would give me

710
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,440
Zhengnian Villa.

711
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,200
I don't care for his villa.

712
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,200
Ling Feng told me the story

713
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,400
of you and Feng Suige.

714
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,140
Now, I'm just seeking a cure

715
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,070
for Feng Suige,

716
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,550
and also for your sake.

717
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,920
I wish for you two

718
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,350
to spend the rest

719
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,920
of your lives together.

720
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,020
Thank you, Lady An.

721
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,330
In the past, every time I came here,

722
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,700
Huang would be sticking around the tree.

723
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
He's also an unfortunate man.

724
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,040
Lord Ling told me

725
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,350
that you saved

726
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Huang's life too.

727
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,190
I did save his life,

728
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,700
but he forgot everything.

729
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
He can't remember

730
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
about himself and his wife.

731
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,070
He has a wife?

732
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,240
How come I've never seen her?

733
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,510
Huang always sits here alone,

734
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,720
all by himself.

735
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,920
His wife passed away.

736
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,160
When she was gathering herbs for Huang
in the mountain,

737
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,790
a venomous snake bit her.

738
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,350
By the time someone found her,

739
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,310
she had died.

740
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,750
She took this very path to the mountain.

741
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,440
After her passing,

742
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,670
Huang would come and spend time

743
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,840
under this tree every day,

744
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,710
[IIIII]

745
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,960
rain or shine.

746
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,590
Nobody knows why.

747
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,510
[IIIII]

748
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,590
Does he...

749
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
keep track of time with these lines?

750
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,219
[IIIII]

751
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,710
You're right.

752
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,960
There are about 60 groups of such lines,

753
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,670
totalling over 300 strokes.

754
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,280
If I remember correctly,

755
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,190
his wife died 10 months ago.

756
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,070
That was about 300 days.

757
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:49,880
It means

758
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,590
Huang carves a line each day,

759
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,630
to mark

760
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,280
how long it has been since his wife left.

761
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,400
Huang hasn't forgotten her.

762
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,420
He always remembers his wife.

763
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,990
He lingers here every day

764
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,150
in the hope of seeing

765
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,210
his wife come back.

766
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,940
[IIIII]

767
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,000
Right.

768
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,280
Love is deeply engraved in one's heart.

769
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,110
Love can't be

770
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,170
easily forgotten.

771
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,360
Lady An,

772
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,660
I don't believe

773
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,960
Feng Suige would

774
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,330
easily forget about me.

775
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,230
I must still have a place
in his heart.

776
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:25,760
I firmly

777
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,160
believe he remembers me.

778
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,320
I don't have to

779
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,670
disappear from his life.

780
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,960
There must be other ways

781
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,020
to remind him of me.

782
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,070
Let me think about it.

783
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,100
[Liu Xinglan]

784
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,250
[Shen Wu] [Wang Lang]

785
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,000
This contains the information

786
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,010
of all the civil and military officials
of Susha.

787
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:55,420
[Diligence and Care for the People]

788
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,400
The Empress Dowager asked me

789
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,190
to carefully study this document,

790
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,360
and to decide which of these officials

791
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,290
are worth establishing ties with.

792
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,550
After all, I've just ascended the throne.

793
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,360
My rule has not been consolidated yet.

794
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,690
I need the assistance of loyal officials.

795
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,000
What's your opinion, Minister Shen?

796
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,960
Your Majesty is

797
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,000
absolutely

798
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,280
correct.

799
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,590
Then who do you think

800
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,760
I should bond with?

801
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,290
-I lack the wit to...
-I'll pick you then.

802
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
What do you think?

803
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,230
I...

804
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,110
[Diligence and Care for the People]

805
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,550
thank Your Majesty
for giving me this honor.

806
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,030
Not so quick.

807
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,800
Aren't you curious

808
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,150
why I chose you?

809
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,530
This humble servant

810
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,850
implores Your Majesty

811
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,070
to enlighten him.

812
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,030
After spending over a decade
working in the court,

813
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,090
you've become an expert in politics.

814
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,320
You're also good at
flattering and pleasing others.

815
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,920
You should have held great power

816
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,800
and become a key official of Susha.

817
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,600
But you have a particular habit—

818
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,190
you only curry favor
with those who are influential

819
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,230
without truly submitting yourself

820
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,320
or pledging loyalty

821
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,280
to them.

822
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,960
That's why though you can't be

823
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,620
anyone's trusted confidant,

824
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,130
you can still live a comfortable life.

825
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,050
Even when the Zhuang family fell,

826
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,000
and many were implicated,

827
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,760
you managed to stay out and unscathed.

828
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,150
I'm so sorry.

829
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,190
Alright.

830
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,230
I'm giving you a chance

831
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,190
to work as my confidant.

832
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,560
Are you onboard?

833
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,510
But I've already been

834
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,880
Your Majesty's confidant this entire time.

835
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,440
Everything I have belongs to Susha

836
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,960
and was given by Your Majesty.

837
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,150
I'm showing much sincerity here.

838
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,550
Stop patronizing me,

839
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,820
Minister Shen,

840
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,960
or I'll make you retire.

841
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,800
I'm glad to be Your Majesty's confidant

842
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,320
and loyal servant till my last breath.

843
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,800
Good.

844
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,280
The first task I assign you

845
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,260
is to find out
the cause of death of the late Emperor.

846
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,960
But, Your Majesty,

847
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,490
it's been made clear

848
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,190
that the late Emperor
was murdered by the First Prince.

849
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,280
It is known to all.

850
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,190
I'm asking for the truth.

851
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,910
You're recovering well.

852
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,670
Fortunately, you're strong enough

853
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,530
to survive such severe injuries.

854
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,210
Elder Zhou, Lu Ke told me

855
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,650
that you went to great lengths

856
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,750
to save my life.

857
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,030
I'll never forget

858
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,880
this tremendous favor.

859
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,600
Not at all.

860
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:17,920
Zhou,

861
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,670
have you figured out a way

862
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,920
to cure his amnesia?

863
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,660
No medicine will work.

864
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,960
At the moment,

865
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,490
I can't think of a solution.

866
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,020
All of you, get out.

867
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,460
I'm telling you to get out.

868
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,250
This matter only concerns him and me.

869
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
Your Highness...

870
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,300
Leave the room.

871
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,130
Keep calm, Your Highness.

872
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,280
Lu Ke told me you had left.

873
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,520
Why did you suddenly go away?

874
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,670
Because...

875
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,840
I didn't want to hurt you.

876
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,070
Then why did you come back?

877
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,140
Because...

878
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,360
I missed you.

879
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,630
Back off!

880
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,710
I heard from Lu Ke and Ling Feng

881
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,820
that I had forgotten many things.

882
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,000
They said

883
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,070
you were the love of my life.

884
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,320
I am.

885
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,230
But nothing they say

886
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,150
can erase the memory

887
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,850
of you shooting an arrow at me.

888
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,190
How am I supposed to believe
all of this is true?

889
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,220
Feng Suige, you know what?

890
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,620
I used to deeply regret

891
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,440
shooting that arrow at you

892
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,270
and nearly ending your life.

893
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,280
But now I'm feeling grateful.

894
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,550
I'm grateful for that arrow attack,

895
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,570
since it makes you remember me.

896
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,880
Of course I remember you.

897
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,800
You were the Red-Clad General of Jinxiu,

898
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,760
Fu Yixiao.

899
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,550
Yes.

900
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,400
You were my sworn enemy.

901
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,400
Yes.

902
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,590
We fiercely fought against
each other on the battlefield,

903
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,480
resorting to every means

904
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,940
to take each other's life.

905
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,150
Yes.

906
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,400
Then how do you explain this?

907
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,920
How did you become the love of my life?

908
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,220
It can't be explained.

909
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,670
And it needs no explanation.

910
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,020
We simply fell in love.

911
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,670
There was no reason for that.

912
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,500
But I don't recall.

913
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,840
It has just temporarily slipped your mind.

914
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,110
