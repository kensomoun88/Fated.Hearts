[Episode 24]

3
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,759
Your Highness, please halt.

4
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,090
No one may trespass in the Inner Palace without permission.

5
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,600
Come here, come here.

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,620
[Ning'an Hall]

7
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,000
What an impressive show of force,
Your Highness!

8
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,380
You actually stormed into the palace
with your men.

9
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,190
Are you staging a rebellion?

10
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,870
What rebellion?

11
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,150
These are merely guards from my household.

12
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,810
How could such a small number
stage a rebellion?

13
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,940
What a joke.

14
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,090
Since when are household guards allowed
into the imperial palace?

15
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,630
I know perfectly well what you're up to.

16
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,080
Don't think

17
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,610
you can control
His Majesty's life and death.

18
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,530
I'm still here.

19
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,310
You're slandering me.

20
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,520
There's no need

21
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,630
for this back-and-forth bickering.

22
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,030
It's just a waste of time.

23
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,750
Heaven will judge
whether you're loyal or treacherous.

24
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,010
As long as I'm here,

25
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,020
you can't harm His Majesty
in the slightest.

26
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,630
You can't stop what I intend to do.

27
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,520
Stop him!

28
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,640
Today, by the order of my ancestors,

29
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,440
I am here to protect His Majesty.

30
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,829
Anyone who dares to stop me

31
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,190
will be killed without mercy!

32
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,390
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

33
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,380
T-Terrible news! Terrible news!

34
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,060
Terrible news!

35
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,600
His Majesty...

36
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,260
His Majesty has disappeared!

37
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,150
Where is His Majesty?

38
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,720
That's what I should be asking you.

39
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,180
I just entered the palace.

40
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,000
You've guarded His Majesty

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,190
in the palace the entire time.

42
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,920
Where did you send His Majesty?

43
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,190
With the Jinwu Guards present,

44
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,940
no one can take His Majesty away.

45
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,000
Since the Jinwu Guards are also gone,

46
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,250
it can only mean

47
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,409
His Majesty woke up and left on his own.

48
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,830
If someone

49
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,270
had forcibly abducted His Majesty,

50
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,270
there would be signs of a fight here.

51
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,390
Even Eunuch Ma

52
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,830
and Lord Ling are gone.

53
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,750
This can only mean His Majesty himself

54
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,040
wanted to leave.

55
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
But why would His Majesty

56
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,670
leave?

57
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,310
[Zichen Hall]

58
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,720
Don't you dare step forward!

[Zichen Hall]

60
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,560
If you are truly

61
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,920
as loyal as you claim

62
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,850
and have been guarding
His Majesty all along in the palace,

63
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,980
why didn't he inform you when he awoke?

64
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,360
From my understanding of His Majesty,

65
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,750
he would never leave the palace

66
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,880
unless he sensed grave danger within.

67
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,250
How could there be any danger
in the palace?

68
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,050
You're just spouting nonsense.

69
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,850
You just said

70
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,820
I can't stop you from doing what you want.

71
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,430
You've been colluding with Murong Yao,

72
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,770
having him
secretly conspire with Xia Jingshiâ€”

73
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,420
what is your real scheme?

74
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,200
Murong Yao is your friend.

75
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,600
He's been colluding with Xia Jingshi,

76
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,930
and you want to kill him.

77
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
But what does that have to do with me?

78
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,500
I don't care what plot you have,

79
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,310
but if you dare

80
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,130
threaten His Majesty's safety,

81
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,700
I won't let you off.

82
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,840
Since His Majesty has awakened,

83
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,920
when he returns,

84
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,430
you will pay

85
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,270
for what you did today.

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,550
[Zichen Hall]

87
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:27,720
Let's go.

88
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:30,800
Get them!

[Zichen Hall]

90
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,740
Your Highness.

91
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,120
The Imperial Guards' duty is

92
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,720
to protect the royal family.

93
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,750
Today, you're going to

94
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,350
stop me for the sake of
a treacherous official?

95
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,870
Your Highness,

96
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,320
please don't make things difficult for us.

97
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,440
Come here.

98
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,790
Come closer.

99
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,440
Prime Minister,

100
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,909
the First Prince has not committed

101
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,110
any act of rebellion.

102
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,550
As for his crime
of trespassing in the palace,

103
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,510
only His Majesty himself can
pass judgment.

104
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,490
We dare not stop him.

105
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,030
His Majesty left the palace,

106
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,870
and you were completely unaware.

107
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,750
How fitting

108
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,410
for Susha's Imperial Guards!

109
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,720
If you can't find His Majesty,

110
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,050
end your lives and atone for your failure!

111
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,320
Yes.

112
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,220
Your Highness,

113
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,170
behind Rongyang Palace is

114
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,670
the rear gate of the imperial palace.

115
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,630
I left from there,

116
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,830
and no one stopped me.

117
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,150
Today, I wandered the streets for a while,

118
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,630
shook off those tailing me,

119
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,490
and found out who they really are.

120
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,480
Good.

121
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,680
Have we made contact

122
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,720
with Wang Encheng?

123
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
His grandfather followed the late emperor
on campaign

124
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,790
and earned battle honors.

125
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,120
He was granted a hereditary post and,

126
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,600
with his grandfather arranging it,

127
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,430
married the niece
of the Marquis of Bao'an.

128
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,840
From then on, his official career was
smooth sailing.

129
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,650
But now...

130
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,910
his wife

131
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,430
has been favored by Xia Jingyan.

132
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,810
The affair has caused quite a stir.

133
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,960
The whole city knows about it.

134
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,620
He can only swallow his anger.

135
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,390
Now he's full of grievances,

136
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,070
and everyone avoids him.

137
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,570
There's also

138
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,920
the Vice Minister of Works... Dai Quan?

139
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,370
Yes.

140
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Xia Jingyan's been supervising work
on the Empress Dowager's mausoleum,

141
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,530
and Dai Quan has been
at the construction site on Mount Gu.

142
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,990
I haven't reached him yet.

143
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,630
But I have made contact

144
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,650
with the others.

145
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,130
When you went to find those people,

146
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,330
did anyone see you?

147
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,530
I found Wang Encheng

148
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,460
at a restaurant.

149
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,880
There must have been people who saw us.

150
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,560
Any word from Bai Shouzhuo?

151
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,910
He said he's found a couple of

152
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,240
the men you're looking for.

153
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
They are all placed in key positions.

154
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,360
He also said that
if Your Highness has further instructions,

155
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,490
you can leave messages in the Library.

156
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,280
How about

157
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,120
I go to the Library again?

158
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,700
No need.

159
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,250
You should just focus on those officials

160
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,980
and stay out of palace affairs.

161
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,550
I had the maids

162
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,790
brew some flower tea.

163
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,390
My Prince, if you like it,

164
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,520
please try it first.

165
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,150
When Your Highness the Princess left
Rongyang Palace today,

166
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,410
did anyone follow you?

167
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,170
A guard followed me,

168
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,360
but seeing

169
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,020
I was just out to pick flowers,

170
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,840
he kept watch from outside the hall
at a distance.

171
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,640
What's wrong?

172
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,510
Your Highness,

173
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,370
how about we...

174
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,330
Is there anything I can do?

175
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,750
I know you don't want to

176
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,280
be under house arrest here.

177
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,200
If there's anything I can do,

178
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,960
just say it.

179
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,190
What are you worried about, My Prince?

180
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,150
Right now,

181
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,410
we're in the same boat.

182
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,840
Besides, I don't want to

183
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,170
be trapped here either.

184
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:37,030
[Murong Residence]

185
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,360
Go to the palace.

186
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,720
Yes.

187
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,600
[Murong Residence]

188
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,240
I put the Imperial Guards
under your command.

189
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,200
How could you have no clue

190
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,060
when His Majesty left the palace?

191
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,840
If His Majesty didn't want anyone to know,

192
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,040
he had plenty of ways.

193
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,510
What I'm worried about now is

194
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,610
why he left.

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,550

196
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,390
already noticed

197
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,360
what I'm planning to do?

198
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,630
You mean he's been awake this whole time,

199
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,160
just pretending to fool us?

200
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,200
Feng Pingcheng cannot be underestimated.

201
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,460
Without such methods,

202
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,140
how could it

203
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,200
have been his turn
to become emperor back then?

204
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,120
Then, with one imperial edict,

205
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,920
he could have us both destroyed.

206
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,470
Why leave the palace at all?

207
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,670
If it's really as you sayâ€”

208
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,270
that Feng Pingcheng knows everythingâ€”

209
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,000
once he returns to the palace,

210
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,130
it will be our death.

211
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,410
We must find him quickly

212
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,240
and kill him.

213
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,960
I don't want to implicate my father.

214
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,270
I don't want my father to die
because of me.

Even now,

216

you're still thinking
only about your father?

Everything I'm doing

218
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,360
is for my father

219
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
and for our Murong family!

220
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,970
Then help me kill Feng Suige.

221
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,030
As long as he dies,

222
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,510
Chengyang will be the sole heir

223
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,420
of Susha.

224
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,680
Feng Pingcheng waking up
won't change a thing.

225
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,960
After Chengyang ascends the throne,

226
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,970
you'll become

227
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,850
the only prince
of a different lineage in Susha.

what your family deserves.

232
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,870
Only in this way

233
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,080
can you bring peace

234
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,010
to your father's spirit in heaven.

235
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,870
What nonsense are you talking about?

236
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,270
What "spirit in heaven"?

237
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,030
You're insane.

238
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,840
What makes you think
you can stand against Feng Suige?

239
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,910
If the Feng Battalion marches rapidly,

240
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,240
they'll reach the city gates within a day!

00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,040
ask your old man yourself in a moment.

376
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,550
Oh, and

377
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,030
he's witnessed

378
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,510
too much treachery these past few days.

379
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,460
He's in a bad mood.

380
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,650
Don't provoke him.

381
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,440
Your Highness,

382
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,210
His Majesty is waiting for you.

383
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,790
Since my mother passed away,

384
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,800
he's never set foot here again.

385
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,350
I thought he'd forgotten

386
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,350
my mother even had a residence here.

387
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,670
Go ahead.

388
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,620
I'll wait for you outside.

389
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,740
Greetings, Your Majesty.

390
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,770
How is Your Majesty's health?

391
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,750
I heard

392
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,010
you barged into the palace with your men.

393
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,680
For what purpose?

394
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,190
To protect Your Majesty.

395
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,690
Why wasn't it to stage a palace coup
and seize the throne?

396
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,440
That throne of mine

397
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,520
doesn't tempt you at all?

398
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You were unconscious for many days,

399
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,920
so you probably don't know

400
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,390
what's happened in the palace.

401
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,540
What could possibly be new?

402
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,440
Treacherous ministers
controlling the court,

403
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,990
officials taking sides,

404
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,890
rebels revealing their ambitions,

405
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,200
and sycophants clinging to

406
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,270
whoever has powerâ€”

407
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,110
the same old story.

408
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,200
I raised an army at 28,

409
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,550
founded the nation,
and became emperor at 33.

410
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,900
To this day, I've reigned for 25 years.

411
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,400
There's no court intrigue

412
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,920
or palace turmoil

413
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,880
I haven't already seen.

414
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,000
You're suffering from a terminal illness
and didn't tell me.

415
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,510
You woke up three days ago

416
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,720
and still didn't tell me.

417
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,390
What?

418
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,440
Do I have to report everything to you?

419
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,200
Are you blaming me

420
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,880
for forcing my way into the palace today?

421
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,030
Zhuang Shen is plotting treason,

422
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,510
and the palace is full of danger.

423
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,480
I brought men to the palace

424
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,590
because I didn't want you to die...

425
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,790
If I died,

426
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,680
wouldn't that be

427
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,480
your heaven-sent opportunity?

428
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,570
I've waited all these days,

429
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,790
yet you've shown

430
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,240
no intention whatsoever
of rebelling to seize the throne.

431
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,270
I've painstakingly groomed you for years,

432
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,480
yet you don't even have

433
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,610
a spark of ambition to become emperor!

434
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,160
You've disappointed me greatly.

435
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,810
By your logic,

436
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,510
I was wrong not to

437
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,350
rebel and usurp the throne

438
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,310
while you lay dying?

439
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,070
Yes.

440
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,880
Of course you were wrong!

441
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,420
You are utterly wrong!

442
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,280
You are my son.

443
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,640
You should've coveted the throne.

444
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,350
You should've wished me dead!

445
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,770
You should've schemed day and night

446
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,560
to take this empire for yourself!

447
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,360
That is what you,
as the First Prince of Susha,

448
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,790
ought to do.

449
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,070
Do you think the throne

450
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,360
will automatically be yours once I die?

451
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,070
If you don't fight for the throne,

452
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,790
it'll

453
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,090
fall into someone else's hands!

454
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,070
I have no interest in your throne.

455
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,500
That is exactly

456
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,960
what I despise most about you.

457
00:23:59,480 --> 00:23:59,830
Sit.

458
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,510
How is your arm now?

459
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,240
Let me see.

460
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,880
Everyone says you're a miracle worker.

461
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,960
Well, I've nearly fully recovered.

462
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Now, when I draw the bow,

463
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,830
it doesn't feel

464
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,290
as strenuous as it used to.

465
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,050
Here, grip my wrist.

466
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,440
Good, good.

467
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,840
You've recovered well.

468
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,720
You've recovered really well.

469
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,110
I'm telling you,

470
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,750
you'd better take good care of that arm.

471
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,400
I'll be

472
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,590
boasting about treating your armâ€”

473
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,920
don't make me look bad.

474
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,800
Don't worry.

475
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,720
Something big is going to happen
in Yujing City.

476
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,070
If you have no pressing matters,

477
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,470
come stay at my Zhengnian Villa
for a while.

478
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,600
I appreciate your kindness,

479
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:53,960
but...

480
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,750
I can't leave yet.

481
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,760
You're right.

482
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,240
This family has

483
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,520
far too many tangled problems.

484
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,550
You think I'll simply wait to be killed?

485
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,610
The realm I conquered with my bloodâ€”

486
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,670
you think I'd just hand it to others?

487
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,480
I must personally choose an heir

488
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,270
while I'm still alive.

489
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,000
Are you telling me this

490
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,590
just to say

491
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,510
you've chosen me?

492
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,960
What else?

493
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,130
Other than you,

494
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,920
I have no choice.

495
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,850
Of course you do.

496
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,240
Xiyang, Chengyang,

497
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
they're your children too.

498
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,590
Nonsense.

499
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,990
Xiyang is a woman.

500
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,400
So what?

501
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,030
If she becomes empress,

502
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,090
I'll personally go

503
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,240
chop off the heads of

504
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,440
those who oppose her.

505
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,110
Child,

506
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,880
you think you can

507
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
stand against the whole world?

508
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,890
Fine.

509
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,500
If you dare not choose a woman to rule,

510
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,720
you still have Chengyang.

511
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,890
I will never let

512
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,470
someone with the Zhuang bloodline

513
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,070
inherit my throne!

514
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,960
This one won't do,

515
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,550
and that one you refuseâ€”

516
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,750
why so many concerns?

517
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,720
You clearly still

518
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,750
-cling to your imperial ambition.
-That's because you're not cruel enoughâ€”

519
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,320
not enough to shatter my obsession.

520
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,680
When I fell gravely ill,

521
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,590
you didn't seize the opportunity
to expand your power

522
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,710
or take my throne.

523
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,420
You actually stayed at my bedside
playing the dutiful son...

524
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,850
What I do is my business.

525
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,680
No, no, no.

526
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,070
I, Feng Pingcheng,

527
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,100
don't need a filial son!

528
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,490
What I want is

529
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,350
an heir with ambition and spine,

530
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,820
with courage and cunningâ€”

531
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,480
one who would betray the world

532
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,310
if necessary

533
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,070
to become a mighty ruler!

534
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,350
Then listen up!

535
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,850
Being your son

536
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,740
is my misfortune.

537
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,480
I never agreed

538
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,400
to be your heir.

539
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,480
What you've pursued your entire life

540
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,960
means nothing to me!

541
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,270
I don't care

542
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,960
for your empire at all.

543
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,640
Stop!

544
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,720
After Feng Pingcheng awoke,

545
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,520
he could no longer feel his legs.

546
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,120
He probably won't be able to
stand up again.

547
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,960
I'm not sure

548
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,510
how much longer he can live.

549
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,400
Let him be.

550
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,040
What happened to your legs?

551
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,920
Go.

552
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,430
Why look back?

553
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,590
The way you look now

554
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
is exactly

555
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,270
like your mother.

556
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,200
Since you're sick,

557
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,110
I won't hold your coming here

558
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,440
against you.

559
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,350
But how dare you mention my mother?

560
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,480
Do you know

561
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,160
how this unfinished chess game came to be?

562
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,200
This was the last game

563
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,480
your mother and I played.

564
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,640
In this game,

565
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,650
she clearly could have let me off,

566
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,760
but she left me no escape.

567
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,240
She was always like thisâ€”

568
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,530
fiercely competitive,
refusing to let me win.

569
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,240
Don't you dare mention her.

570
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,750
I often racked my brains wondering

571
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,590
how to turn the tables

572
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,370
and defeat her.

573
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,080
She wanted to winâ€”

574
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,750
as if I didn't.

575
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,270
Haven't you always wanted to know

576
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,830
how your mother

577
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,240
really died?

578
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,240
-You're finally willing to tell me.
-That's because after all these years

579
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,790
of painstaking planning,

580
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,680
I'm finally about to win.

581
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,920
Many people have speculated

582
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,680
about the real cause

583
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,010
of your mother's death.

584
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,550
Some think

585
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,750
it was because she controlled
the Storm Alliance

586
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,280
and refused to submit to me.

587
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,590
Others think

588
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,070
it was because she was a Jinxiu spy,

589
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,600
and I was suspicious of her.

590
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,960
A mere Storm Allianceâ€”

591
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,160
why would I fear it?

592
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,880
I don't even

593
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,210
take Jinxiu seriously,

594
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,000
so why would I care about

595
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,350
claims she was their spy?

596
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,750
I remember everything

597
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,880
that happened

598
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,280
on the day my mother died.

599
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,110
If you dare speak even half a lie,

600
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,440
I will never let you off.

601
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,960
In your mother's heart,

602
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,550
there were always things
more important than me.

603
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,400
Though she accompanied me
in conquering the world,

604
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,680
she never treated me

605
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,400
as emperor.

606
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,340
[16 years ago]

607
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,830
She never saw me

608
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,270
as her entire world.

609
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,480
She never belonged to me,

610
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,200
never let me truly possess her,

611
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,270
and never submitted to me docilely.

612
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,000
Mom, I caught crabs!

613
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,960
As the First Prince,

614
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,410
Suige should be the Crown Prince.

615
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,830
You promised that

616
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,240
when he grew up,

617
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,400
inheriting the throne
would be entirely his decision.

618
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,800
You can't interfere now.

619
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,720
So, catching crabs in the countryside

620
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,320
isn't interfering with him,

621
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,240
but me naming him

622
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,440
Crown Prince is?

623
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:41,870
"Naming"?

624
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,590
I told you before:

625
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,030
in this small courtyard,

626
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,750
you're not allowed to

627
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,280
act like an emperor with me.

628
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,510
Mom!

629
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,980
A crab is crawling out!

630
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,720
Chop it!

631
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,400
I'll chop anyone who dares act arrogantly

632
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,440
before me.

633
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,100
I couldn't control her.

634
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,960
I knew that one day

635
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,720
she'd leave me,

636
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,310
as if I'd never owned

637
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,480
her at all.

638
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,480
Why should she have belonged to you?

639
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,270
Just because she refused to submit,

640
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,750
you let Zhuang Shen

641
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,070
and Zhuang Jingyuan kill her?

642
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,870
Because she tried to take you...

643
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,240
from me!

644
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,880
Come on, sit here.

645
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,810
Is it comfortable?

646
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,580
Then stay in the palace

647
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,490
and rule from here.

648
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,210
From now on,

649
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,640
you'll sit in this chair,

650
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,160
okay?

651
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,070
No.

652
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,070
I promised Mom that

653
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,960
when I grow up,
I'll roam the world with her.

654
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,350
You listen to your mother

655
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,480
but not your father?

656
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,310
If Father wanted to make you emperor
in the future,

657
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,880
you wouldn't want that either?

658
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,640
Mom said

659
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,440
that ever since you became Emperor,

660
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,920
you've become a different person.

661
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
She said becoming emperor

662
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
turns people bad.

663
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,280
I wanted you to inherit the throne.

664
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,200
I wanted to raise you to be
an even greater ruler,

665
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,530
destined to leave a more glorious legacy!

666
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,620
But she undermined my plans

667
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,390
and crossed my final line.

668
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,240
I would never allow it.

669
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,480
So you killed her?

670
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,580
Was it you who killed her?

671
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,880
All these years,

672
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,790
I've asked you again and again

673
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,200
whether you wanted to be Crown Prince.

674
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,680
You never appreciated it,

675
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,750
insisting you wanted to be a general

676
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,110
who protects the nation
and guards the land.

677
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,790
That's when

678
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,200
I knew

679
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,250
you'd never forgotten
what your mother said.

680
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,240
She's been dead all these years,

681
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,590
yet her words still hold sway over you.

682
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,790
You tell me,

683
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,240
did she deserve to die?

684
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,750
Enough!

685
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,830
She had no great ambitions

686
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,000
and was short-sighted,

687
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,110
just like a common peasant woman!

688
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
She wasn't worthy of being your mother,

689
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,240
let alone worthy of being my Empress!

690
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,400
Shut up...

691
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,160
Suige,

692
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,110
you cannot be like her.

693
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,880
I gave her

694
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,970
every honor,

695
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,710
yet she showed no gratitude.

696
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,640
Who did she think

697
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,000
she was?

698
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,750
She pretended to be so aloof.

699
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,270
She pretended to be a hermit.

700
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,000
She even pretended to be
so pure and untainted!

701
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,640
Through and through, she was nothing

702
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,790
but a peasant woman!

703
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,070
Shut your mouth!

704
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,110
I'll kill you!

705
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,590
Come on!

706
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,720
Kill me!

707
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:38,720
Suige,

708
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,860
just saying it won't do.

709
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,400
Don't you hate me?

710
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,380
Do it!

711
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,800
Kill me!

712
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,400
I simply don't think you hate me enough!

713
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,510
Kill me!

714
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,400
Your mother

715
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,710
died because of you!

716
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,440
Shut up!

717
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,710
I'll ask you one last time:

718
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,070
how did my mother die?

719
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,630
Back then, before she died,

720
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,710
she pointed a sword at me

721
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,070
just like this.

722
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:33,909
[Changchun Palace]

723
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,190
Greetings, Your Majesty the Empress.

724
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,320
Greetings, Your Majesty the Empress.

725
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,719
[Changchun Palace]

726
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,230
Your Majesty the Empress,

727
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,020
the Jinxiu spy we caught

728
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,670
has confessed
that you're also an accomplice.

729
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,870
Your personal maid

730
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,630
has also testified

731
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,960
that you secretly met with Jinxiu people.

732
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,530
In your bedchamber,

733
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,730
we found

734
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,060
secret correspondence
between you and Jinxiu people.

735
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,160
Feng Pingcheng,

736
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,590
just based on

737
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,350
this petty frame-up,

738
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,540
you want to arrest me and interrogate me?

739
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,550
As long as you remain in the palace,

740
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,250
trust meâ€”

741
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,020
I'll find out the truth for you

742
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,680
and clear your name.

743
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
Stay for how long?

744
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,220
You just want to

745
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,860
trap me in the palace.

746
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,710
Why the excuse?

747
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,440
We are husband and wife.

748
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,590
I can choose not to pursue

749
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,310
the suspicion that you're a Jinxiu spy.

750
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,920
If you insist on leaving,

751
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,670
I won't have anyone

752
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,670
stop you.

753
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,320
But...

754
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,710
I won't allow you

755
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,670
to take Suige and Xiyang with you.

756
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,760
They are my children.

757
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,170
Why can't I take them?

758
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,140
I'm not discussing this with you.

759
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,890
Feng Pingcheng,

760
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,740
look in the mirror

761
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,550
and see

762
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,920
what you've become!

763
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,760
You've been blinded by your lust
for power.

764
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,160
This imperial palace

765
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,110
has become your cage.

766
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,000
I will never

767
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,920
let my children

768
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,070
follow your path.

769
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,580
Listen up,

770
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,770
from now on,

771
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,880
those two children

772
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,730
have nothing to do with you whatsoever.

773
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,590
Try taking them and see what happens.

774
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,550
Sister, it's in your nature

775
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,380
to resist staying in the palace for long.

776
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,480
Because of that, His Majesty

777
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,160
has lost his temper many times
over the years.

778
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,960
Now that things have come to this point,

779
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,670
Sister, please don't

780
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,150
provoke His Majesty further.

781
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,290
The children are better off raised here

782
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,420
in the palace

783
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,400
than suffering hardships outside.

784
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,280
In the future, I'll take care of

785
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,510
those two children for you.

786
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,630
Please rest assured.

787
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,960
Who do you think you are?

788
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,380
I'm talking to Feng Pingcheng.

789
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,840
You have no place to speak!

790
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,970
Your Majesty the Empress,

791
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,400
you bear the title

792
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,000
yet refuse to share His Majesty's burdensâ€”

793
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,590
you disgrace the position.

794
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,230
I've long

795
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,640
since tired of being this Empress.

796
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,400
Wei Qingyu.

797
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,110
Do you know what you're saying?

798
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,600
Listen up, Feng Pingcheng,

799
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,600
I will never let Suige

800
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,400
follow your path,

801
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,400
trapped by power as you are.

802
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,030
His path forward

803
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,880
will be his own choice.

804
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,560
Stop, all of you!

805
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,320
Suige must stay.

806
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,150
This is

807
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,400
not up to you.

808
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,080
Protect His Majesty!

809
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,600
I warned you long agoâ€”

810
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,630
I'll cut down anyone who dares to

811
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,090
act arrogantly before me!

812
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,870
You are no exception.

813
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,160
Your Majesty!

814
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,840
Since the moment she died,

815
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,320
these past 15 years,

816
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,220
I've devoted myself to one thingâ€”

817
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,190
molding you, through relentless effort,

818
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,230
into exactly the person

819
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,400
I envisioned.

820
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,110
When you were a child,

821
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,280
you were just like your motherâ€”

822
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,630
the kindness and compassion in your bones

823
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,140
made me sick.

824
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,070
You are my son.

825
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,320
You're in the royal family.

826
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,880
You are the heir I've chosen!

827
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,550
You must be even more cold-blooded

828
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,280
and ruthless than I am!

829
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,830
Xiyang and I had only one mother.

830
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,490
I don't want her to raise us.

831
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,920
From now on,

832
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:08,590
she...

833
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,190
is your mother.

834
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,150
So you did all of that on purpose.

835
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,440
On the day my mother died,

836
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,960
the first thing you said to me

837
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,710
was to make me

838
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,570
accept someone else as my mother.

839
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,280
From that moment on,

840
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,960
you meant to make me hate you.

841
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,960
Without soul-deep hatred,

842
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,960
how else could I have

843
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,890
rid you of the weakness inside you?

844
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,150
All these years,

845
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,230
you've clawed your way forward

846
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,560
on your own.

847
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,480
My painstaking efforts were not in vain.

848
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,070
You've gone mad.

849
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,000
Only through madness can one win.

850
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,520
You only care about victory

851
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,960
and yourself!

852
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,110
My mother died because of you!

853
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,440
-You never deserved her!
-I deserved her!

854
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,110
I gave her

855
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,770
all the beautiful things,
but she refused them.

856
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,880
What she rejected, I give to you.

857
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,100
Am I wrong?

858
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,360
I want to hand you the realm I conquered

859
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,000
with my own blood! Am I wrong?

860
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,790
Am I...

861
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,280
Go on, keep shouting and cursing!

862
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,480
Why have you stopped?

863
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,850
I'm holding the sword.

864
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,070
You know your son

865
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:23,670
won't kill you.

866
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,360
But I will!

867
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,380
I won't show you any mercy!

868
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,760
When my son and I are talking,

869
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,800
it's not your place to interrupt.

870
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,800
Your son?

871
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,230
In what way do you resemble a father?

872
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,280
Although I have no parents

873
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,880
or kin,

874
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,000
I know

875
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,960
real families

876
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,120
are not like this.

877
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,630
I've never seen a father

878
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,170
hurt his son like this

879
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,690
or force his son like this!

880
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,150
The "son" you speak of

881
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,840
is nothing but a tool

882
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,000
to carry on your ambition!

883
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,530
What kind of father are you?

884
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,880
This is the investiture edict.

885
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,620
I've already named you Crown Prince.

886
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,480
All these years,
I've kept Zhuang Shen alive

887
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,510
only to use him

888
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,840
as a means to hone you!

889
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,840
I'm handing you the thing
I've treasured most

890
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,560
in my life!

891
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,440
Go!

892
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,760
Storm the palace,

893
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,880
seize the imperial seal,

894
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,080
and stamp this edict.

895
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,550
Then you will be the Crown Prince.

896
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,440
Kill me! After I die,

897
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,170
you'll be the emperor of Susha!

898
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,110
I'm entrusting the nation to you!

899
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:18,000
You must make this country even stronger!

900
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,840
That's just your wishful thinking!

901
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,030
That's not what Feng Suige truly wants!

902
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,490
You need say no more!

903
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,070
You don't love him at all.

904
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,590
You just have no other choice.

905
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,190
Have you ever protected him?

906
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,000
Where were you

907
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,030
when he needed you?

908
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,920
You keep saying

909
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,980
you are his father,

910
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,150
but have you ever done

911
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,750
one thing a father should do?

912
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,440
Look at

913
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,770
what you've become now.

914
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,590
Abandoned by all, family shattered,
wife dead, and children estranged.

915
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,320
You treat your son

916
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,240
like an enemy,

917
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,280
yet still pretend to be

918
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,960
a loving father.

919
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,070
Aren't you ashamed of such hypocrisy?

920
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,670
And now

921
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,440
you're taking refuge here.

922
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,670
This was his mother's place.

923
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,630
Do you even deserve to be here?

924
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,400
I am a wise ruler.

925
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,000
You don't understand
my painstaking efforts

926
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,230
or my duty to family and country!

927
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,380
Do you understand?

928
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,210
As it's said,

929
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,880
family comes before country!

930
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,150
You don't even care for your own familyâ€”

931
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,710
how can you speak of duty
to family and country!
