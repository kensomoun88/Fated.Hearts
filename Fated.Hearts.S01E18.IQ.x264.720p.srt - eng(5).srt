[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,940
[Episode 18]

3
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,790
Your Highness.

4
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,650
Your Highness.

5
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,460
Ning Fei...

6
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,430
is gone.

7
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,810
Impossible.

8
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,870
How could that be?

9
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,450
He was fine when I saw him in prison.

10
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,980
That's what Yixiao told me.

11
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,610
But I think Yixiao

12
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,870
might have been lying,

13
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,520
because Ning Fei was gravely injured

14
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,380
by people sent by Empress Zhuang.

15
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,050
If anything had happened to him,

16
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,000
given Yixiao's temper,

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,030
she would have turned Yujing City

18
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,150
upside down.

19
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,770
There's no way she'd be this calm.

20
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,120
The fact that the Three Heroes of Jinxiu

21
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,250
ended up like this

22
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,840
was all my fault.

23
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,120
I insisted on getting rid of Yixiao.

24
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,080
Send some people

25
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,430
to quietly look into

26
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,830
Ning Fei's whereabouts.

27
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,520
Yes.

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,530
How is she?

29
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,829
What do you mean?

30
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,150
What do you think?

31
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,430
You didn't listen to me.

32
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,910
I told you not to use force,
but you did anyway.

33
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,079
And now you're asking me how it is?

34
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,630
Don't you know the answer yourself?

35
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,280
Lord Ling,

36
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,000
the situation was urgent at the time.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,630
I didn't think it through.

38
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,710
She got hurt because of

39
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,290
your urgent situation?

40
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,280
Father,

41
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,000
this isn't the time for such talk.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
Hurry and check Yixiao's injury.

43
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,190
Don't I need to understand the situation?

44
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,960
Can it be as easy

45
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,750
as you say?

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,870
Can a solution really be

47
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,070
that easy to think of?

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,860
I've actually thought of a solution.

49
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,190
Father,

50
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,630
what solution? Tell us.

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,140
Don't keep us in suspense.

52
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,800
Alright.

53
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,430
But I don't dare

54
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,640
use it lightly.

55
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,630
It's not as simple
as treating muscle and bone injuries.

56
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,360
It's like scraping the bone
to remove the poison.

57
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
Scraping the bone?

58
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,329
We need to cut through the flesh here

59
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,860
to repair the meridians.

60
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,800
If all goes well,

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,390
she'll recover full mobility.

62
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,120
If not,

63
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,390
she'll be crippled for life.

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,870
Cutting through the flesh?

65
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,870
Wouldn't that make the injury even worse?

66
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,130
What do you know?

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,950
Her injury is in the meridians and bones.

68
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,000
You think a bit of ointment on the skin

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,510
would heal it?

70
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,100
Miss,

71
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,360
don't worry.

72
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,750
After taking the anesthetic,

73
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,409
you'll just sleep through it.

74
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,720
But it will hurt a lot

75
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,850
when you wake up.

76
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,080
No.

77
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,350
Think of another way.

78
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,070
It's alright.

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,070
I trust you.

80
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,159
The First Prince let the princess

81
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,360
and her husband go without permission.

82
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,870
Perhaps

83
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,350
he has been secretly in contact
with Jinxiu.

84
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,020
The Prince Consort's
returning to his country

85
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,280
is understandable.

86
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,810
He could have reported it to you.

87
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,360
You wouldn't have refused his request.

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,330
Prime Minister Zhuang.

89
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,530
Don't you have anything to say?

90
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,430
This matter seems suspicious.

91
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,040
We should wait for the First Prince
to return

92
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,900
and explain everything clearly.

93
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,650
Has the First Prince returned?

94
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,510
Your Majesty,

95
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,390
he entered the city early this morning.

96
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,490
He's back in the capital

97
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,150
but hasn't come to report?

98
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,200
Summon him to the palace immediately!

99
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,120
Yes.

100
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,690
Your Highness,

101
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,950
His Majesty summoned you to the palace.

102
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,510
Greetings, Your Highness.

103
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,830
How is she?

104
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,390
She won't die.

105
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,820
This...

106
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,190
His Highness

107
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,600
has some affairs to attend to.

108
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,160
Sir, please wait a moment.

109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,860
Your Highness,

110
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,710
the palace attendant is waiting for you.

111
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,820
Tell him to wait.

112
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,320
I'll personally apologize
to His Majesty afterward.

113
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,670
Your Majesty,

114
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,520
shall we discuss it tomorrow?

115
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,870
When will he arrive?

116
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,960
Where is His Highness?

117
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,720
That female general of Jinxiu is injured.

118
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,750
Stop whispering.

119
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,670
Just tell me directly.

120
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,350
Your Majesty,

121
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,600
His Highness...

122
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,960
Tell me.

123
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,880
Say it right there!

124
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,480
His Highness is handling urgent matters
at his residence

125
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,140
and cannot respond to your summon
immediately.

126
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,360
Cannot respond to my summon?

127
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,360
Didn't you ask him

128
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,100
what matter in this world could be

129
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,410
more important than seeing His Majesty?

130
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,720
Your Majesty!

131
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,480
The...

132
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,750
female general of Jinxiu
at First Prince's Residence

133
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,350
has been seriously injured.

134
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,800
The First Prince is staying by her side
to watch over her.

135
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,010
Her left arm must not be moved,

136
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,090
and her shoulder wound must stay dry.

137
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,060
Thank you for this,

138
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,770
Young Mistress.

139
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,670
You should thank my father.

140
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,800
In all my life,

141
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,200
I've only seen him perform

142
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,360
this meridian restoration technique twice.

143
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,760
It takes immense effort.

144
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,050
After today,

145
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,840
he'll probably need several days

146
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,440
to fully recover his energy.

147
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,370
I'll remember this favor.

148
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Don't mention it.

149
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,440
Just take good care of my sister.

150
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,040
There's still a risk
of permanent disability.

151
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,060
Mr. Ma came personally.

152
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,640
What?

153
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,080
Was he afraid I wouldn't follow the order,

154
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,140
so he sent you to drag me to the palace?

155
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,720
This is no joke this time.

156
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,640
Be careful when you talk to him.

157
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,230
Thank you for your trouble, Mr. Ma.

158
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,770
His Majesty didn't sleep all night,

159
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,600
and today in the hall

160
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,810
he was truly angered.

161
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,960
Only because of
the court officials' presence

162
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,360
did he restrain himself.

163
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,790
Your Highness, please be understanding.

164
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,020
His Majesty is getting on in years.

165
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,440
Just let him scold you a bit

166
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,360
and don't argue with him,

167
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,090
or you'll make him angry again.

168
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,990
[Zichen Hall]

169
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,550
Since Prince of Zhennan arrived,

170
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,440
His Majesty has lost
his appetite and sleep—

171
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,970
truly wearing himself out.

172
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,870
I see.

173
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,120
[Zichen Hall]

174
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,830
I, Feng Suige,

175
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,090
pay my respects to His Majesty.

176
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,020
Rise.

177
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,630
I am guilty.

178
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,920
Your Majesty, please punish me.

179
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,870
Rise and speak.

180
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,250
When Xiyang was seven,

181
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,790
she accompanied me on an incognito tour.

182
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,450
I don't know

183
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,150
which rascal

184
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
she got this from.

185
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,960
She treasured it immensely.

186
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,870
She cherished it

187
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,670
far more than
all her gem- and pearl-encrusted

188
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,080
trinkets.

189
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,550
Are you resenting me?

190
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,020
I failed to bring Xiyang back,

191
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,720
so I deserve punishment.

192
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,670
I told you to rise,

193
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,010
yet you're still kneeling?

194
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,270
Stand up!

195
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,440
Xiyang has always been thoughtful

196
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,080
since she was a child.

197
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,640
I injured my shoulder years ago.

198
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,050
She knows that

199
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,000
whenever it rains,
my old injury flares up,

200
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,080
and my shoulder aches unbearably.

201
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,320
So whenever it rains,

202
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,080
she comes to keep me company,

203
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,510
bringing candies

204
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,030
and talking with me

205
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,790
to cheer me up.

206
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,790
People say

207
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,390
daughters will eventually

208
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,190
marry into someone else's home.

209
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,050
But Xiyang wrapped her arms around my neck

210
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,330
and said she'd never marry

211
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,730
and that she'd always be my daughter.

212
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,000
All lies.

213
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,910
My son and daughter…

214
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,000
My daughter eloped,

215
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,320
and my son...

216
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,670
actually defied my imperial decree

217
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,720
for a woman.

218
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,570
Fu Yixiao was gravely injured

219
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,870
saving me.

220
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,960
Your Majesty, when your decree arrived,

221
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,480
she was at a critical moment.

222
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,810
I couldn't abandon her.

223
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,550
And to me,

224
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,680
she isn't just any woman.

225
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,310
She is the woman
I'm willing to stay with for life,

226
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,000
never leaving nor forsaking.

227
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,080
I've already lost my daughter.

228
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,920
I don't want

229
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,000
to lose a son as well.

230
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,070
Fortunately, our dynasty has a rule—

231
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,960
princes

232
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,770
have no saying in their own marriages.

233
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,110
I know.

234
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,700
Then why do you still talk to me this way?

235
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,510
Your Majesty,

236
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,680
you won't lose a son.

237
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,880
After all, Chengyang is filial.

238
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,740
He has never defied you.

239
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,910
You failed to bring Xiyang back.

240
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Tomorrow at court,

241
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,130
the officials will surely give you
a hard time.

242
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,350
Hou Jing has already gone to

243
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,070
the Capital Garrison for inspection,

244
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,730
and there will be no one in court
to speak for you.

245
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,720
You'd better be fully prepared to face

246
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,290
their attacks and criticism in court.

247
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,840
All right. You may go now.

248
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,440
Go back to

249
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,400
your female general of Jinxiu.

250
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,140
From now on,

251
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,250
do whatever you want.

252
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,190
No one will stop you anymore.

253
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,860
Then, Your Majesty, why did you

254
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,400
summon me today?

255
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,110
Before Xiyang's wedding,

256
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,400
I prepared her a lavish dowry—

257
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,990
all her favorite things.

258
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,040
She left in a hurry this time

259
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,160
and couldn't take it with her.

260
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,830
Later,

261
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,760
have someone deliver it to her.

262
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,400
My daughter

263
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,560
will always be my daughter,

264
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,100
no matter whom she marries

265
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,750
or where she goes.

266
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,790
Go now.

267
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,110
Yixiao.

268
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,960
Don't move.

269
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,570
You're finally awake.

270
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,070
Once your meridians heal,

271
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,070
your injury will be completely cured.

272
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,600
That's what my father said.

273
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,800
Don't worry.

274
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,320
Thank you.

275
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,400
Where is Feng Suige?

276
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,880
He went to the palace.

277
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,110
You were unconscious,
so you didn't see it.

278
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,920
Today, for you,

279
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,550
he defied the imperial order.

280
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,280
I used to be biased against him,

281
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,440
but today I've completely changed my view.

282
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,160
Sister,

283
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,610
you were so badly injured for Feng Suige.

284
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,640
Your love

285
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,720
will not be in vain.

286
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,580
He defied the imperial order?

287
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,870
Your Majesty.

288
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,200
You've had a long day.

289
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,300
Please go back and rest early.

290
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,110
Alright.

291
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,160
Your Majesty!

292
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,760
It's fine.

293
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,200
Your Majesty!

294
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,030
[Zichen Hall]

295
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,030
Your Majesty!

296
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,350
Summon Prime Minister Zhuang
to the palace.

297
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,000
Yes!

298
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,480
[Zichen Hall]

299
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:42,830
[Zichen Hall]

300
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,480
In a few days,
the wound will start to itch.

301
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,480
You must resist the urge to touch it.

302
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,000
Also,

303
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,200
the dressing needs to be changed

304
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
every day.

305
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,970
You two talk.

306
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,900
I'll go prepare the medicine.

307
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,590
You're awake?

308
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,610
I heard from Xueying

309
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,200
that you defied the imperial order for me.

310
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,260
Were you punished?

311
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,890
Does it hurt?

312
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,960
No.

313
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,920
How could it not hurt?

314
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,550
You need to change the dressing every day,

315
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,170
right?

316
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,850
I'll do it for you.

317
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,750
Okay.

318
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,760
It's fine now.

319
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,710
From now on,

320
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,830
I'll be your left hand.

321
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,350
Of course you can be

322
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,110
my left hand.

323
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,590
But you have

324
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,190
more important things to do.

325
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,630
I'm not some fragile woman.

326
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,550
This is nothing.

327
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,750
Yixiao,

328
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,680
things are different now.

329
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,510
In front of me,

330
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,110
you don't need to put on a brave face.

331
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,860
Who's putting on a brave face?

332
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,480
Look.

333
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,830
Don't move.

334
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,240
See? It's fine.

335
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,770
Lord Ling truly is a miraculous doctor.

336
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,430
The wound is healing quickly.

337
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,550
By tomorrow,

338
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,150
this bandage can be removed.

339
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,710
But you still need to follow instructions.

340
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,030
Don't worry.

341
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,640
It's fine.

342
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,100
Your Highness.

343
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,100
I promise I won't move around.

344
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,750
Go take care of your business.

345
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,410
I'll wait for you to come back.

346
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,720
Get some good rest.

347
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,510
Bad news from the palace.

348
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:00,790
Lord Ling.

349
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:04,960
Lord Ling.

350
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,000
I've been busy

351
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,750
all day for you.

352
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,250
I'm sleeping now. Get out!

353
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,730
You must

354
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,560
help me with this matter.

355
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,410
I must have owed you in my past life.

356
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,510
What could you possibly need me for?

357
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,210
Either treating your wounds

358
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,750
or helping you save someone's life.

359
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,270
Let's go.
Don't waste time. Tell me on the way.

360
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:31,870
Thank you.

361
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,360
My medicine box!

362
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,410
And my shoes!

363
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,420
It's been over an hour.

364
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,830
Has no one figured out

365
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,580
what illness His Majesty has?

366
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,970
How is His Majesty now?

367
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,110
Your Majesty,

368
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,110
His Majesty suffered
a sudden surge of anger,

369
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,040
which caused him to cough up blood.

370
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:14,790
But...

371
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,930
But logically,

372
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,690
he should've regained consciousness
by now.

373
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,350
Then why hasn't he?

374
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,830
Well...

375
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,000
What should we do?

376
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,500
Your Majesty.

377
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,440
Prime Minister Zhuang.

378
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,790
His Majesty is blessed with great fortune.

379
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,050
He will surely be fine.

380
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,000
Your Majesty, please don't worry.

381
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,790
In the current situation,

382
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,200
we must not panic.

383
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,550
Father, are you saying...

384
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,440
We must prepare

385
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,770
for all possibilities.

386
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,880
The most pressing matter now

387
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
is to immediately contain this news

388
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,860
and keep everyone away from here—

389
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,960
especially Feng Suige.

390
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
I will stay here for the next few days

391
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,310
and watch over His Majesty with you.

392
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,960
The entire Imperial Hospital staff
are all our people.

393
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,270
You can rest assured.

394
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,440
Physician Xu.

395
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,590
Your Majesty.

396
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,350
Prime Minister Zhuang.

397
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,150
Physician Xu,

398
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,980
you were personally selected
by Prime Minister Zhuang

399
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,440
and promoted
to head of the Imperial Hospital.

400
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,170
You are our trusted confidant.

401
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,790
You must keep a close watch

402
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,270
on His Majesty's condition

403
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,220
without any negligence.

404
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,240
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

405
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,270
I understand.

406
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,410
Your Highness.

407
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,810
[Zichen Hall]

408
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,080
Where are the Imperial Guards?

409
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,810
Where is Murong Yao?

410
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,720
Suige!

411
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,880
What's going on?

412
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,760
I don't know.

413
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,510
I was suddenly summoned

414
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,160
to guard His Majesty's chambers.

415
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,090
The order from inside

416
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,480
is that no one is allowed to enter.

417
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,740
Who issued that order?

418
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,760
The Empress.

419
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,740
[Zichen Hall]

420
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,100
[Zichen Hall]

421
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,880
His Majesty said

422
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,550
he doesn't want to see anyone right now.

423
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,880
Falsely claiming to speak
on His Majesty's behalf

424
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,310
is punishable by death.

425
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,450
Even the Empress is no exception.

426
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,520
First Prince,

427
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,790
the imperial physicians say
His Majesty needs rest.

428
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,000
This is Lord Ling from Zhengnian Villa.

429
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,030
Among all the physicians in the world,

430
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,160
if his medical skill ranks second,

431
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,440
no one dares claim to be first.

432
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,570
Zhengnian Villa?

433
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,720
Lord Ling?

434
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,830
There are plenty of physicians
in the Imperial Hospital,

435
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,550
each with exceptional skills.

436
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,270
We don't need
a wandering physician interfering.

437
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,730
Those physicians of your Imperial Hospital

438
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,380
aren't even qualified
to be my apprentices.

439
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,070
Lord Ling,

440
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,240
this is the imperial palace,

441
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,810
not your Zhengnian Villa.

442
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,920
And His Majesty isn't like

443
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,400
the villagers you treat every day

444
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,530
at Zhengnian Villa.

445
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,310
His Majesty suddenly fell ill.

446
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,110
I specifically brought in

447
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,370
the best doctor in the world to treat him.

448
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,750
Yet tonight,
the Empress and Prime Minister Zhuang

449
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,750
are obstructing us at every turn.

450
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,940
What exactly are your intentions?

451
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,330
Don't try to slander us.

452
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,270
His Majesty was fine

453
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,330
before seeing you.

454
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,310
After meeting you, he fell ill.

455
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,720
And you have the nerve

456
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,320
to come here and question us?

457
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,550
I don't want to

458
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,480
waste time arguing with you today.

459
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,210
I'll say this one last time—

460
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,480
get out of my way.

461
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,940
[Zichen Hall]

462
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,200
Lord Ling!

463
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,740
Lord Ling,

464
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,090
please come in quickly!

465
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,830
Mr. Ma,

466
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,740
what are you doing?

467
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,680
Your Highness may not be aware,

468
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,030
but Lord Ling comes to the palace annually

469
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,440
to examine His Majesty's health.

470
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,300
He is someone His Majesty trusts.

471
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,200
Lord Ling.

472
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,780
Thank you.

473
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,600
After you.

474
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,030
Father, are you aware

475
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,590
that Lord Ling comes to examine

476
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,450
His Majesty's health every year?

477
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,270
Keep a close eye on the people

478
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,160
the First Prince brought.

479
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,590
Yes,

480
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,800
Your Majesty.

481
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,350
Lord Ling's medical skills
are extraordinary.

482
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,450
We are just

483
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,140
his juniors.

484
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,630
With Lord Ling here,

485
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,830
His Majesty's illness can be cured.

486
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,280
Your Majesty,

487
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,240
you can rest assured now.

488
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,890
What are you doing?

489
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,200
Lord Ling,

490
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,680
His Majesty's pulse

491
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
is floating and weak.

492
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,750
The left cun position

493
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,590
shows signs
of overexertion and blood deficiency.

494
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,590
He's the Emperor—

495
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,020
what Emperor isn't overexerted
and blood-deficient?

496
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,850
Why do you look familiar to me?

497
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,320
You remember me?

498
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,300
Ten years ago,

499
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,440
at Zhengnian Villa,

500
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,070
I studied pulse diagnosis

501
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,470
from you for a few months.

502
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,800
I see.

503
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,600
Don't mention this to anyone
in the future.

504
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,290
Lord Ling,

505
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,680
earlier, we applied acupuncture
to His Majesty's Governing Vessel

506
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,030
using the Lingshu acupuncture technique.

507
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,200
Lord Ling,

508
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,880
was that appropriate?

509
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,070
Yes.

510
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,930
Of course it was.

511
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,370
This treatment would be appropriate

512
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,580
for just anyone.

513
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,030
It's just a safety method—

514
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,110
neither helpful nor harmful.

515
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,640
It won't save him,
but it won't kill him either.

516
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,350
Ma Qiming.

517
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,510
There are too many people here.
The air is stale.

518
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,880
Even healthy people would fall ill.

519
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,740
Clear the room.

520
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,440
Lord Ling.

521
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,680
I won't disturb you.

522
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,590
Please allow me to stay

523
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,190
and observe your treatment.

524
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,070
Your Emperor fell ill

525
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,960
just so you could learn from it?

526
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,880
Get out!

527
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,510
The imperial physicians cannot leave.

528
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,480
How can we entrust His Majesty's life

529
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,030
entirely to you alone?

530
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,990
Then ask them

531
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,000
if they dare to speak

532
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,930
while I'm treating patients.

533
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,550
Your Majesty,

534
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,290
Lord Ling is right.

535
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,070
It would be better

536
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,640
if there were fewer people here

537
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,550
and more quiet.

538
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,640
When I perform acupuncture,

539
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,240
I don't like to be disturbed.

540
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,480
Please leave, you three.

541
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,160
No!

542
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,790
I must stay by His Majesty's side.

543
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,780
Guards!

544
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,920
Escort Her Majesty back to her palace.

545
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,750
Leave!

546
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,100
First Prince,

547
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,400
do you still see me

548
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,350
as the Empress?

549
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,250
I only care about His Majesty's
well-being.

550
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,050
How ridiculous.

551
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,920
I've never seen you

552
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,440
show such filial devotion before.

553
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,590
Are you leaving or not?

554
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,720
What if I don't?

555
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,640
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

556
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,350
The First Prince

557
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,960
is just concerned
about His Majesty's illness.

558
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,240
No matter what, Lord Ling is

559
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,480
the best physician in the world.

560
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,160
He is familiar with His Majesty's
medical history.

561
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,440
With him treating His Majesty,

562
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,310
you and the Prime Minister
need not worry too much.

563
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,200
Besides,

564
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,920
I am here.

565
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,880
Your Highness,

566
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,260
why don't you step outside first?

567
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,630
Since everyone is here

568
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,590
for His Majesty's illness,

569
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,510
let's not keep Lord Ling

570
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,110
and His Majesty waiting any longer.

571
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,440
Everything is for His Majesty.

572
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,190
Everything is for Susha.

573
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,000
Then I'll trouble you, Lord Ling.

574
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,730
Don't worry.

575
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,219
[Zichen Hall]

576
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,010
Today,

577
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,000
what exactly did you say to His Majesty?

578
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,920
Why did he fall gravely ill

579
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,120
right after you left?

580
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,510
This isn't the time to assign blame.

581
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,760
Let's wait until His Majesty wakes up.

582
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,680
First Prince,

583
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,980
please go back now.

584
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,800
I will stay here.

585
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,650
Go and get Chengyang here.

586
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,530
He's also a prince.

587
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,190
He should be just as filial.

588
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,550
Alright.

589
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,370
You're worried about Feng Suige?

590
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,680
Drink your medicine first.

591
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,710
Here.

592
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Isn't it bitter?

593
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,880
It's not that the medicine isn't bitter.

594
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,010
It's just that your mind is elsewhere.

595
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,590
I wonder what exactly happened

596
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,920
in the palace.

597
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,090
He didn't look well today.

598
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,090
Worrying like this all day

599
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,940
isn't good for your recovery.

600
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,690
Come out with me tomorrow.

601
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,880
We can bring Fang and Shunzi

602
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,510
along.

603
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,110
They haven't seen you for days

604
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,240
and they're really worried about you.

605
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,360
With my hand like this, can I go out?

606
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,630
Not with anyone else—

607
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,530
but you have me, don't you?

608
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,190
Alright.

609
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,780
I'll listen to the medical fairy.

610
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,920
Chengyang,

611
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,070
aren't you tired from standing so long?

612
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,600
Come have something to eat.

613
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,550
I'm not tired.

614
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,500
I have no appetite.

615
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,150
Suige,

616
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,880
Father...

617
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,160
won't really be in danger, will he?

618
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,360
With Lord Ling here,

619
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,500
His Majesty will wake up.

620
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,060
[Zichen Hall]

621
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,610
[Zichen Hall]

622
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,930
It's already 1 AM.

623
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,360
Please go back and get some rest,
everyone.

624
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,000
No.

625
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,750
I will stay here.

626
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,480
After His Majesty wakes up,

627
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,840
he will need you to tend to him.

628
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,770
You must not exhaust yourself now.

629
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,640
Mr. Ma is right.

630
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,280
Your Majesty,
you've been exhausted all day.

631
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,810
You should go back and rest.

632
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,670
His Majesty is gravely ill
and unable to attend court.

633
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,630
I will return to court immediately

634
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,150
to handle all affairs

635
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,740
to prevent any unrest.

636
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,680
If there's any news,

637
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,670
Mr. Ma, please

638
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,440
send word to me at once.

639
00:37:59,070 --> 00:37:59,670
Yes.

640
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,180
Your Highnesses, please go back as well.

641
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,230
I'll stay here with my brother.

642
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,740
Mother, Grandfather,

643
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,590
please rest early.

644
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,590
[Zichen Hall]

645
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,550
[Zichen Hall]

646
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,710
How is he?

647
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,800
Don't worry.

648
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,680
With me here, he'll be fine.

649
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,330
When will His Majesty wake up?

650
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,960
I still need
to give him acupuncture today.

651
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,160
You two have been here all night.

652
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,420
You should go back now.

653
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
Neither of you will leave, right?

654
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,010
Fine.

655
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,070
You'll be in charge of the acupuncture,

656
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,930
and you'll feed him his medicine.

657
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,130
I'm going back now.

658
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,230
Lord Ling.

659
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,630
Lord Ling is right.

660
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,320
You two have been here

661
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,190
all night.

662
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,400
Go back and get some rest.

663
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,130
I'll be here.

664
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,280
Besides treating his illness,

665
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,920
please also keep a close watch

666
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,070
on His Majesty's safety,

667
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,960
in case someone tries to do something.

668
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,760
Rest assured.

669
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,710
If anything happens,

670
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,910
send someone to inform me immediately.

671
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,580
Don't worry.

672
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,010
Go back and get some rest.

673
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,330
I'll see you out of the palace,
Your Highness.

674
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,500
I'm hungry.

675
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,710
I'll prepare some food for you right away.

676
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,770
I want lots of meat.

677
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,710
Red drum.

678
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,210
How about this one?

679
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,150
Slow down. Be careful.

680
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,420
Sister,

681
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,390
what are you planning to do next?

682
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,680
I asked you before

683
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,590
to go back to Zhengnian Villa with me.

684
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,050
Have you thought about it?

685
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,420
I can't leave yet.

686
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,520
We haven't found Meng Junran.

687
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,550
I can help Feng Suige if I stay.

688
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,110
But I think

689
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,960
you should think about

690
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,890
your own future.

691
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,110
Wouldn't it be nice for us

692
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,470
to return to Zhengnian Villa

693
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,870
with the 3 kids

694
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,040
and live a peaceful life together?

695
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,630
I know you mean well.

696
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,090
Don't worry.

697
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,480
I'll be fine.

698
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,670
Your Highness, you often

699
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,960
anger His Majesty,

700
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,840
but now, in a time of hardship, you are
showing how much you care for him.

701
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,590
Mr. Ma,

702
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,760
I remember that early this year,

703
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,840
His Majesty took back command

704
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,030
of the Jinwu Guards.

705
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,280
Now the Jinwu Guards

706
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,340
should be under your command, right?

707
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,030
The person His Majesty trusts most

708
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,800
is neither the princes and princesses,

709
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,860
nor any powerful officials at court—

710
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,400
it's you, Mr. Ma.

711
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,690
Your Highness, please speak plainly.

712
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,530
You know what I mean, Mr. Ma.

713
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,090
Even in ordinary households,

714
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,440
someone needs to

715
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,280
keep watch for unexpected visitors,

716
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,410
let alone in His Majesty's residence.

717
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,460
Your Highness, rest assured.

718
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,600
The Jinwu Guards

719
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,550
have been around His Majesty
the whole time.

720
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,280
That's good.

721
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,180
Mr. Ma, please stay.

722
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,420
His Majesty needs people by his side.

723
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,700
Your Highness.

724
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,670
You failed to bring Her Highness back
this time.

725
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,190
Some at court are already saying

726
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,030
that you deliberately

727
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,890
helped Prince of Zhennan escape.

728
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,460
Nonsense.

729
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,760
It was clearly me

730
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,110
who sent the letter
to the Emperor of Jinxiu...

731
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,670
Of course it's nonsense.

732
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,440
But now that His Majesty is unconscious,

733
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,230
it is Prime Minister Zhuang
who is controlling the court.

734
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:54,830
Moreover,

735
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,480
the female general of Jinxiu
in your residence

736
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,360
was indeed

737
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,110
a subordinate of Prince of Zhennan.

738
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,110
If anyone tries to take advantage

739
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,760
of His Majesty's unconsciousness
to move against you,

740
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,440
then that

741
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,670
Jinxiu female general in your residence

742
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,270
will become your weak point.

743
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,320
Your Highness,

744
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,550
please be careful.

745
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,510
Please enjoy.

746
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,000
Miss Xue.

747
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,670
You're here early today.

748
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,510
The ladies instructed me

749
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,170
to come pick it up early today.

750
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,330
How's business lately?

751
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,230
Not bad.

752
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,680
Sister,

753
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,940
aren't you hungry?

754
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,400
You eat first.

755
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,200
Two bowls of noodles.

756
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,840
Something's wrong.

757
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,290
That day, Wu Ying was waiting for someone.

758
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,290
It wasn't until she appeared that…

759
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,360
Take care.

760
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,230
Bye.

761
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:52,710
Sister.

762
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,690
Are you alright?

763
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,030
You eat with them first.

764
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,090
I'll be right back.

765
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:02,630
Eat up.

766
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,480
Miss Xue, you're back?

767
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,070
Yes.
