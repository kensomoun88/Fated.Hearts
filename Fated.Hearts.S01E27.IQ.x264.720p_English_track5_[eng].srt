00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,730
Marquis, can you do me a favor,

382
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,410
by bringing my father back to life?

383
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,920
I've heard

384
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,810
[Songcheng Hall]

385
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,970
what happened to Zhuang Shen.

386
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,160
Marquis,

387
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,320
are you also going to
say "condolences" to me?

388
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,490
I can't bring myself...

389
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,200
to say that word.

390
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,550
Marquis,

391
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,590
thank you.

392
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,400
I hate that word more than anything
right now.

395
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,690
Out of my way!

396
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,380
I have to go in to meet His Majesty.

398
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,590
Unless His Majesty
removes me from my position,

399
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,550
I am still the Empress of Susha.

400
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,120
Standing in my way like this

401
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,750
shows utter disrespect!

402
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,130
I can have you executed right now.

403
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,920
Move aside!

who said that?

409
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,880
Miss Yixiao said it.

410
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,960
But doesn't His Highness often tell us

411
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,240
to always keep our composure?

412
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,310
Why is he hanging on Miss Yixiao's

413
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,000
every word now?

414
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,920
What do you think the reason is?

415
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,680
Can you take a break

416
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,310
from archery practice
and use your brain for once?

417
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,590
We're drinking already.

418
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,590
Go on. Have more.

419
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,310
Drink as much as you can!

-Great!

Come on.

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,040
Let me fill Your Highness's glass.

431
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,950
On this joyful occasion,

432
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,690
let's forgo the formalities.

Stop eating.

00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,720
You practiced for a sword dance, right?

444
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,960
Perform it for His Highness.

445

Do it now.

why not let me perform a sword dance?

Oh my.

466
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,240
Look how shy His Highness is.

467
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
That's not someone shy would do!

468
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,550
Alright.

469
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,510

00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,240
not all of you

471
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,000
get to call her

472

"Mrs. Feng."

473
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,240
Only I have that privilege.

474
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,950
Says who?

475
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,640
All of us are His Majesty's buddies.

476
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,070
We should call her "Mrs. Feng"!

477
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,790
Am I right, guys?

478
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,310
Right!

-Mrs. Feng!
-Mrs. Feng!

will be punished with drinks!

483
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,790
-punish us with drinks!
-Drinks!

484
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,790
Raise our glasses!

485
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,270
Come on!

486
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,440
Mrs. Feng,

487
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,240
I'll drink this up to show my respect,

488
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,640
since I'm bad with words.

489
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,800
Mrs. Feng,

490
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,600
thank you.

The credit goes to all of you.

493
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,950
Thank you for your hard work.

494
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Here's a toast to you!

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,880
-To Mrs. Feng!
-To Mrs. Feng!

496

497
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,350
many thanks for your efforts.

498
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,210
I'd like to make a toast to you all!

499
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,030

Drink up!

502
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,510
Now that you're here,

503
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,160
just feel free to

504
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,640
speak your mind.

505
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
Today marks

506
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,680
the end of our marriage.

507
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,130
There will be no need

508
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,020
to see each other again
in the rest of our lives.

509
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,480
I'm not here

510
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,880
to salvage our marriage.

511
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,160
I'm here for Chengyang.

512
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,350
For Chengyang?

513
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,440
What now?

514
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,200
Hearing that the First Prince

515
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,130
has completely severed ties with me,

516
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,200
you can't wait to secure
the throne for Chengyang?

517
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,960
Now, I finally realize

518
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,000
how you actually think of me.

519
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,200
What you're really like

520
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,080
doesn't matter anymore.

521
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,400
I will not pass the throne
on to Chengyang.

522
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,550
Get that idea out of your mind.

523
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,960
If anyone

524
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,070
is to shoulder the blame,

525
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,600
it should be me, his mother.

526
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,650
Your Majesty,
please don't take it out on Chengyang.

527
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,030
I'll bestow

528
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,830
the title of Grand Prince on him.

529
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,270
As long as he assists his brother
with loyalty,

530
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,270
he can live the rest of his life

531
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,720
peacefully.

532
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,590
Loyalty?

533
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,790
How is he supposed to serve

534
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,160
the killer of his grandfather
with loyalty?

535
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,030
How is he supposed to

536
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,070
forget what happened

537
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,400
when he knows it was all true?

538
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,830
As a member of the royal family,

539
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,270
he has no other choice.

540
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,350
This is his fate.

541
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,590
Besides,

542
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,920
though I'll make him a Grand Prince,

543
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,960
he won't be allowed to step

544
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,240
out of Yujing.

545
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,510
This is in the best interests

546
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,330
of him and his brother.

547
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,240
I will not

548
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,570
dismiss you from the position of Empress.

549
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,160
Isn't it

550
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,350
what you want most?

551
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,400
Thank you,

552
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,550
Your Majesty.

553
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,270
I'm tired.

554
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,240
You may leave.

555
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,590
Can I dress

556
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,370
Your Majesty's hair for one last time?

557
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,350
After today,

558
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,440
we will never meet again.

559
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,720
Despite all my mistakes,

560
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,310
I've truly given Your Majesty my heart.

561
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,970
My affection for Your Majesty is genuine.

562
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,240
Your Majesty looks pallid,
after just recovering

563
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,570
from a serious illness.

564
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,680
I would hate to have any regrets

565
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,590
on the day of our parting.

566
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Please grant my wish, Your Majesty.

567
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,790
Is this

568
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,310
your one last request?

569
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,110
Yes.

570
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,080
Your wish is granted.

571
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,350
Thank you, Your Majesty.

572
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,440
Your Majesty,

573
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,310
Chengyang does have a choice.

574
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,920
I won't leave him with no choice.

575
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,170
My son shall not cave in to fate!

576
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,680
Guards...

577
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,070
Guards!

578
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,920
Help...

579
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,070
Murong...

580
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,750
Wait!

581
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,270
I've already...

582
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,270
pardoned...

583
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,480
Protect... Suige...

584
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,790
Protect...

585
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,020
Your Majesty,

586
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,550
I'll settle

587
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,920
this matter for you.

588
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
Will Your Majesty

589
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,150
help my son Yao?

590
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,640
Yes. You have my word.

591
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,210
Many thanks,

592
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
Your Majesty.

593
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,630
Your Majesty,

594
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:07,550
our priority

595
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,760
is to keep His Majesty's death

596
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,310
secret.

597
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,030
I will then

598
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,320
take care of the rest.

599
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,920
Harder! Harder! Harder!

600
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,070
Harder!

601
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,590
Use more strength!

602
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,340
Harder!

603
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,070
Harder!

604
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,070
Try harder!

605
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,510
-Drink up!
-Drink up!

606
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,800
Come on!

609
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,440
-Eunuch Ma.
-Your Grace.

610
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,030
Don't go in yet.

611
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,800
Why, Your Grace?

612
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,480
I have a report

613
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,940
to make to His Majesty now.

614
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,000
Eunuch Ma,

615
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,670
you are His Majesty's most trusted person.

616
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,440
I'm sure His Majesty

617
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,880
would always heed what you say.

618
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,510
I'm very flattered, Your Grace.

619
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,230
His Majesty

620
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,050
would not blindly take my word.

621
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,270
[Imperial Study]

622
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,320
I must save my son.

623
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,110
You have to help me.

624
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,550
Please don't put me in a pickle,
Your Grace.

625
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,520
I'd love to help,

626
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,440
but there's nothing I can do.

627
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,060

628
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,780
[Imperial Study]

629
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,720
To the palace.

630
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,360
Father.

631
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,760
Yao,

632
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,290
all of this was done by the Empress.

633
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,310
Uncle,

634
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,280
I've taken care of

635
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,280
[General of Jinwu Guards, Murong Jie]

636
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,360
all the Jinwu Guards outside,

637
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,760
except those on our side.

638
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,340
I'll go out and keep watch.

639
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,130
Father...

640
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,840
In order to save you,

641
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,670
Feng Pingcheng must die.

642
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,980
Next,

643
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,620
Feng Suige will have to die too.

644
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,690
I believe you've realized

645
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,670
the Murong family

646
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,290
has reached the point of no return.

647
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,210
No. I'm the only rebel here.

648
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,550
I'm the one
who's hit the point of no return.

649
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,440
You and the rest

650
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,440
of the Murong family are innocent.

651
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,440
Father,

652
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,230
I can't drag you into this mess.

653
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,480
Please leave right now.

654
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,030
What happened here

655
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,960
tonight was all my doing.

656
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,760
I'll bear all the consequences.

657
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,320
Go!

658
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,280
Remember this:

659
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,960
there are consequences

660
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,280
to every decision you make.

661
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,070
This decision I'm making results from

662
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,960
the fact that I can't bear

663
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,800
the consequence of losing you.

664
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,250
Only you are the most important
to the Murong family.

665
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Your Highness...

666
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,780
What's up?

667
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,740
Your Highness,

668
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,150
His Majesty has fallen ill again.

669
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,190
Mr. Ma asked me to bring Your Highness

670
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,590
to the palace right away.

671
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,800
Please leave.

672
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,590
But...

673
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,830
Mr. Ma said

674
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,590
His Majesty

675
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,250
was at death's door this time.

676
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,400
Where is His Majesty?

677
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,260
Your Highness,

678
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,590
His Majesty is in the Imperial Study.

679
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,880
Why not in the bed chamber?

680
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,190
Since His Majesty suddenly fell ill

681
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,440
in the Imperial Study,

682
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,300
Mr. Ma summoned
all the imperial physicians there.

683
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,360
Here is the Imperial Study.

684
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,070
Your Highness,

685
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,470
I shall take my leave now.

[Imperial Study]

689
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,980
I didn't want to see you,

690
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,560
but they told me you fell ill again.

691
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,800
Your Majesty!

692
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,830
Your Majesty!

693
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,120
Your Majesty!

694
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,280
Uncle Murong...

695
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,000
Did you do all of this?

696
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,280
Why?
