00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,640
Your Majesty,

192
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,800
I'm innocent.

193
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,530
I'm innocent, Your Majesty!

194
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,510
I wonder why Your Majesty

195
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,240
summoned me so urgently.

196
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,090
Bring him in.

197
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,400
Your Majesty.

198
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,850
What is the meaning of this?

199
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,110
He's confessed everything.

200
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,780
Confessed?

201
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,520
I don't understand.

202
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,440
He says he's the mole

203
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,240
you planted by my side.

204
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,500
Eunuch Bai,

205
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,810
I have no grievances with you.

206
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,220
Why frame me like this?

207
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,710
This servant is innocent...

208
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
This servant hasn't done anything.

209
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,290
Your Majesty,

210
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,920
this servant has been

211
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,530
utterly loyal to you,
as heaven is my witness.

212
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,420
This servant is innocent.

213
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,840
Princess,

214
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
look at those two—

215
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,270
each one more convincing than the other.

216
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,480
I caught them red-handed,

217
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,140
and they're still denying it.

218
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,320
They really won't admit it
until they're at death's door.

219
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,050
Xia Jingshi.

220
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,120
Don't blame me

221
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,650
for not giving you a chance.

222
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,390
If you admit now

223
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,590
that he works for you,

224
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,790
I can spare him

225
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,700
and even return him to you.

226
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,730
What do you say?

227
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,150
Eunuch Bai and I

228
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,600
barely know each other.

229
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,880
I don't understand
what Your Majesty is implying.

230
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,430
Bai Shouzhuo.

231
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,790
I tried.

232
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,240
See? Your master won't save you.

233
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,120
In his heart,

234
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,150
he only cares about himself.

235
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,130
If he truly is not your man,

236
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,240
kill him.

237
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,000
Kill him,

238
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,560
and I'll believe you.

239
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,920
This servant has served in the palace
since childhood...

240
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,270
and has always been
by Your Majesty's side,

241
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,100
never harboring any disloyal thoughts.

242
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
If Your Majesty doesn't believe me,

243
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,960
then let this servant...

244
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,240
prove my loyalty with my life!

245
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,030
It seems this wretched servant

246
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,360
truly isn't your spy.

247
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,200
Of course not.

248
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,000
But why do you

249
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,510
seem somewhat saddened?

250
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,580
Would you like to know

251
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,400
who helped me

252
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,570
catch this wretched servant?

253
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,670
It was me.

254
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,960
Eunuch Bai was only the beginning.

255
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,670
I told you

256
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,750
I'd make you regret it.

257
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,810
Xia Jingshi,

258
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,720
surprised?

259
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,950
Didn't you want to play?

260
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,250
I can play along with you forever.

261
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,250
Your Majesty exaggerates.

262
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,730
If there's nothing else...

263
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,850
I'll take my leave.

264
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,200
Xia Jingshi,

265
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,660
the obsession and infatuation
I once felt for you are gone.

266
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,000
From now on,

267
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,640
you and I are enemies.

268
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,400
This servant has served in the palace
since childhood...

269
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,750
and has always been
by Your Majesty's side,

270
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,010
never harboring any disloyal thoughts.

271
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,860
If Your Majesty doesn't believe me,

272
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160
then let this servant

273
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,960
prove my loyalty with my life!

274
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,500
Your Highness.

275
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,650
I never thought

276
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,800
she would become so vicious.

277
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,110
It's all my fault

278
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,110
that she's become like this.

279
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,790
Shouzhuo's death

280
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,000
was my fault too.

281
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,590
Your Highness, why blame yourself?

282
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,720
It's not your fault.

283
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,680
Feng Xiyang is no longer

284
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,610
the Princess of Susha she once was.

285
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,480
From now on...

286
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,420
we have yet another enemy.

287
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,440
Though she stayed by my side only briefly,

288
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,960
she must have noticed

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,660
something about our affairs.

290
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,550
Should we have our men from the death camp

291
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,680
prepare in advance?

292
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,710
We mustn't rush this matter.

293
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,830
First, we need to identify the guards

294
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,830
placed by the Empress Dowager

295
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,960
around Xia Jingyan,

296
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,240
as well as the patrol routes

297
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,350
of the Royal Guards
throughout the entire  palace.

298
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,880
Our target is Xia Jingyan,

299
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,440
and we need to walk away unscathed.

300
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,530
We only have one chance.

301
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,920
Father, Brother,

302
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,830
do you know?

303
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,920
I killed someone today.

304
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,070
Though not by my own hand,

305
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,880
he died because of me.

306
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,960
The path I must walk

307
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,760
has countless hardships ahead.

308
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,960
In the past, you shielded me

309
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,220
from these hardships.

310
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,270
From now on,

311
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,590
I must face them alone.

312
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,400
I've lived for over 20 years,

313
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,880
yet

314
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,480
never have I been this happy.

315
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,680
Just thinking about

316
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,920
Xia Jingshi's look of defeat

317
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,380
fills me with excitement!

318
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,000
I really didn't expect

319
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,680
that you're not only beautiful

320
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,920
but also so clever.

321
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,150
By the way,

322
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:46,830
do you have

323
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,690
any other ideas

324
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,000
to help me root out

325
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,440
more of Xia Jingshi's spies?

326
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,040
I'll reward you generously.

327
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,060
You seem to have forgotten our wager.

328
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,830
A ruler's word is his bond.

329
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,400
Tell me,

330
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,040
what do you want?

331
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Kill Murong Zhong and his son for me.

332
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,710
You've finally come around!

333
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,410
I'm growing more and more fond of you.

334
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,150
Very well.

335
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's a deal.

336
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,310
What if he hadn't remembered you?

337
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,200
Would you really let him kill you?

338
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,260
Even if I had died, I wouldn't regret it.

339
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,390
You poor star-crossed lovers

340
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,270
truly have been through so much hardship.

341
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,960
Even Heaven wants to help you.

342
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,580
I must thank you for that, Lady An.

343
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,590
I heard from Ling Feng

344
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,550
that you also lost your memory once.

345
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,590
How are you now?

346
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,110
Let me check.

347
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,310
I've now recovered

348
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,310
almost all of my previous memories.

349
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,270
My injured left arm

350
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,870
has almost fully healed too.

351
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,400
Although

352
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,590
Lord Ling previously cautioned me

353
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,550
not to draw a strong bow,

354
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,800
I can feel

355
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,760
that it's fully recovered now.

356
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,140
Your pulse shows you've indeed recovered.

357
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,510
Now, Feng Suige has also

358
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,880
overcome a difficult period.

359
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,750
So what do you plan

360
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,840
to do next?

361
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,310
Let him rest quietly for a few more days.

362
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,370
After that,

363
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,280
we will leave.

364
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,310
Leave?

365
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,240
Yes.

366
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,450
We still have many things to do.

367
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,610
Your Highness,

368
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,960
when your life

369
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,160
hung by a thread,

370
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,510
I didn't dare to leave your side,

371
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,270
so I had no time to look for

372
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,000
Gu Yu, Yun Fang, and the others.

373
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,480
That day when we left Yujing City,

374
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,440
they stayed behind
and held back the pursuers,

375
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,270
and there's been no news of them since.

376
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,750
Their fates are uncertain.

377
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,080
I'm worried about them.

378
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,270
Go quickly and find their whereabouts.

379
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,750
But...

380
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,340
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

381
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,400
You must

382
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,640
also take care of yourself.

383
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,170
Alright.

384
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,370
Please be careful, Your Highness.

385
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,960
How is she doing?

386
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,020
She's fine now.

387
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,600
Where's Ling Feng?

388
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,540
He left,

389
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,400
saying he was going to

390
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,480
discuss matters
with the elder of the Storm Alliance.

391
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,680
Then I'll go find him.

392
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,170
How are you?

393
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,100
Does the wound hurt?

394
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,850
It doesn't hurt.

395
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,010
It really doesn't hurt.

396
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,560
I'm sorry.

397
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,450
You've suffered because of me.

398
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,960
Lu Ke told me everything

399
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,550
that happened after I fell unconscious

400
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,810
from the Golden Acupuncture treatment.

401
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,180
It's all behind us now.

402
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,880
I completely understand

403
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,720
how you feel now.

404
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,110
I still remember

405
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,970
the last words I said to my father,

406
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,270
every single one.

407
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,750
I said that the father-son bond

408
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,640
and the ruler-subject loyalty between us

409
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,500
were severed from that moment on.

410
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,580
You don't need to blame yourself.

411
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,880
Who could have known

412
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,600
those would be your last words with him?

413
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,590
I know you're eager for revenge.

414
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,980
But you must stay calm.

415
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,630
You've only just recovered.

416
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,520
The most important thing now

417
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,130
is your own safety.

418
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,520
Don't worry.

419
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,750
My injuries

420
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,880
have mostly healed.

421
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,070
Compared to revenge, what's more important

422
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,510
to me is your safety.

423
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,390
And Xiyang's.

424
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,560
After Xiyang left,
I was worried about her,

425
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,840
so I sent people to gather information.

426
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,030
She should be

427
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,640
living with Xia Jingshi
in Rongyang Palace by now.

428
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,440
When my father

429
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,770
and I were still around,

430
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,970
Jinxiu still had some restraint.

431
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,480
But now that everything has changed
in Susha,

432
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
her situation must be even more difficult.

433
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,080
And I know my sister better than anyone.

434
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,850
Though she appears gentle,

435
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,350
she's actually strong-willed.

436
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,810
She's been strong-minded since childhood.

437
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,300
No matter what others say,

438
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,830
she will firmly believe

439
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,470
that I could never commit regicide.

440
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,310
Suige,

441
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,680
I don't believe

442
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,200
you would die so easily.

443
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,970
I believe I will see you again.

444
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,220
Before we meet,

445
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,450
I will definitely avenge you.

446
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,750
You are the most

447
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,350
important people in my life.

448
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,750
I'd rather lose my life

449
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,160
than lose either of you.

450
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,240
You won't lose us.

451
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,410
I'll always stay by your side.

452
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,310
Yixiao!

453
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,750
Come in!

454
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,270
I just ran into Lady An.

455
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,280
She told me

456
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,340
he's regained his memory.

457
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,720
Actually, it's nothing important.

458
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,400
Then I'll just take...

459
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,930
Ning Fei.

460
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,430
Thank you.

461
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
During this time,

462
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,030
he's also been very concerned about you

463
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,560
and has helped a great deal.

464
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,680
That day,

465
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,700
I accidentally revealed your identity.

466
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,880
I've always wanted to

467
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,410
apologize to you in person.

468
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,160
It's fine.

469
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,850
It's all in the past.

470
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,670
All right.

471
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,290
Then let bygones...

472
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,810
be bygones.

473
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,530
I'm a simple man.

474
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,490
I'm not good with words.

475
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,380
Let's just say

476
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,790
that the old Ning Fei is dead.

477
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,850
Yixiao is my buddy.

478
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,390
From now on...

479
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,250
I'll treat you as my buddy too.

480
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,760
That's good.

481
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,360
I've mostly recovered.

482
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,840
We'll be leaving here soon.

483
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,300
Do you want to come with us?

484
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,110
You're leaving?

485
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,590
Don't you

486
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,790
know the rules here?

487
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,240
Rules are rules.

488
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,470
There can't be any exceptions!

489
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,180
[Storm Alliance]

490
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,270
Especially not

491
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,450
for a few outsiders.

492
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,070
They never said

493
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,310
they wanted to join the Storm Alliance!

494
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,270
Don't play dumb with me.

495
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,510
Don't you know the rules here?

496
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,110
Once you enter the Storm Alliance,

497
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,310
you become a member of the alliance!

498
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,640
You may never betray it!

499
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,410
Not betraying the alliance
means you cannot leave.

500
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,270
You must stay here

501
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,730
for the rest of your lives.

502
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,110
If you insist on leaving,

503
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,480
then you're

504
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,680
making an enemy of the entire alliance!

505
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,460
Of course,

506
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,490
except for me.

507
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,480
At that time, I was so anxious

508
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
to save Feng Suige

509
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,510
that I forgot about

510
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,590
the rules Lord Ling mentioned

511
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,200
when I brought you here.

512
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,440
I only learned after I was saved

513
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
that you staked your life to save me.

514
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,180
If I leave the alliance,

515
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,000
you'll bear all consequences.

516
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,930
I'll bear whatever consequences there are!

517
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:10,180
[Storm Alliance]

518
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,110
There was a life at stake.

519
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,720
At that time,

520
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,750
to save Feng Suige's life,

521
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,440
I couldn't care about all your rules!

522
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,270
No matter what you say,

523
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,300
he cannot leave!

524
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,640
If you don't agree to my rules,

525
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,440
then you shouldn't have accepted
our treatment!

526
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,570
Who is Feng Suige?

527
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,030
Do you think he'll follow
your alliance rules?

528
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,350
Besides, he carries a deep blood feud!

529
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:20,880
He will definitely

530
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,210
carve a bloody path out!

531
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,400
How?

532
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,350
There are only a few of you.

533
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,000
How many people does the alliance have?

534
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,310
Even if you could take on hundreds of men,

535
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,000
you still couldn't defeat them all.

536
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,460
There will always be a way.

537
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,920
If the power gap is too great,

538
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,780
then we'll find other solutions.

539
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,950
He's right.

540
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,390
Don't worry.

541
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,350
I remember Lord Ling

542
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,310
specifically instructed

543
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,310
the people who brought you here

544
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,830
that they must be blindfolded.

545
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,440
I suppose

546
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,400
the reason no one is allowed to leave

547
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,960
is that they don't want

548
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,000
the alliance's location to be revealed.

549
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
If we swear

550
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,830
never to disclose

551
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,030
the secrets of this place,

552
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,760
perhaps there will be a way out.

553
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,790
I don't trust a word

554
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,850
of the Fengs' oath!

555
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,070
Saving him was already
more than generous of me!

556
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,640
Just tell me,

557
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,750
what would make you compromise?

558
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,350
I can't!

559
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,350
[Storm Alliance]

560
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,270
I only agreed

561
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,200
to save his life.

562
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,680
But I never said

563
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,640
our feud with the Feng family

564
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,750
would be wiped clean!

565
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,200
You...

566
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,320
His father is already dead!

567
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,590
Holding the previous generation's

568
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,980
grudge against him—

569
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,300
isn't that unfair?

570
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,550
The son pays for the father's debts.

571
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,000
It's the natural order of things.

572
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,940
What if I add my personal request?

573
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,760
You're speaking up for them too?

574
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,160
Where there are rules,

575
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,150
there are ways around them.

576
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,400
Ling Feng and his daughter

577
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,920
aren't bound by the alliance covenant.

578
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,520
I also come and go as I please.

579
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,430
Otherwise, let those two

580
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,070
either join Zhengnian Villa

581
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,600
or become my disciples.

582
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,640
That works too.

583
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,240
Good idea.

584
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,160
Lei,

585
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,750
aren't you just afraid someone will reveal

586
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,920
the location of the alliance?

587
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,350
How about this—Lady An and I
will be their guarantors!

588
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,440
That should be enough, right?

589
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,240
Both of you

590
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,920
have saved our alliance before.

591
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,270
You are friends of our alliance.

592
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:44,880
I've always

593
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,030
regarded you as honored guests,

594
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,440
which is why I'm accommodating you.

595
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,960
But that's not enough
to make an exception for them!

596
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Then I must make something clear first.

597
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,550
That girl, Yixiao, has spirit.

598
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,330
I like her.

599
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,640
I'm also the one who cured Feng Suige,

600
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,510
and that's fate.

601
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,440
If there's any conflict in the future,

602
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,700
you must not harm them!

603
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,790
Otherwise,

604
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,180
I will be very angry!

605
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,310
Calm down, calm down.

606
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:03,920
Get off me!

607
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:13,970
Godfather,

608
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,750
Feng Suige's man

609
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,680
tried to leave this place.

610
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,310
The Woodcutter Branch members captured him

611
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,310
and brought him back.

612
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,480
How should we deal with him?

613
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,240
Is it Lu Ke?

614
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,910
Deal with him
according to our alliance rules!

615
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,630
This matter requires
careful consideration.

616
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,760
We can't act rashly.

617
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,740
Well, since there's this rule...

618
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,640
it seems that Lu Ke won't be able to leave

619
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,040
even if I send him outside

620
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,400
to look for our men.

621
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,550
Elder Lei's Woodcutter Branch is

622
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,640
specifically responsible for
the alliance's patrol—

623
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,750
keeping out enemies

624
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,880
and preventing alliance members

625
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,200
from leaving without permission.

626
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,800
I'm afraid

627
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,710
Lu Ke might be in trouble.

628
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,070
Sister!

629
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,200
Sister.

630
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,240
Sister.

631
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,090
Lu Ke is in trouble.

632
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:57,880
Six!

633
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,440
Seven!

634
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,080
Eight!

635
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:02,880
Nine!

636
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,680
Ten!

637
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,590
Eleven!

638
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,290
Twelve!

639
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,080
Thirteen!

640
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:11,750
You guys are serious?

641
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,350
Fourteen!

642
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,320
Fifteen!

643
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,930
Sixteen!

644
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,210
Seventeen!

645
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,320
Eighteen!

646
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,880
Nineteen!

647
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,350
Twenty!

648
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,680
Stop!

649
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,790
Your Highness...

650
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,310
Lu Ke.

651
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,080
I'm fine, Your Highness.

652
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,090
Not hurt at all.

653
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,750
It's nothing.

654
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,680
I'm really fine.

655
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,310
Why did you hurt my man?

656
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,760
He left this place without permission.

657
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,440
According to our alliance rules,
he must be whipped—

658
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,110
50 lashes.

659
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,600
We're only halfway through.

660
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,010
Elder Lei,

661
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,990
we came here

662
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,590
in a hurry seeking medical help.

663
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,310
It was careless of us

664
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,570
to violate your rules.

665
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,030
We sincerely apologize.

666
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,310
Since this is our first offense,

667
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,350
could you please show some leniency?

668
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,590
Only by enforcing punishment
according to alliance rules

669
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,390
will you remember more clearly.

670
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,030
May I ask who made

671
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,310
these rules you speak of?

672
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,970
That's none of your business.

673
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,670
Y-Your Highness,

674
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,790
considering the Storm Alliance
has helped us,

675
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,920
I didn't fight them.

676
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,200
They brought me back here.

677
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,240
-They're actually serious about this...
-Lu Ke!

678
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,920
Keep quiet.

679
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:32,960
Elder Lei,

680
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,590
your alliance saved my life.

681
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,440
I'll never forget that.

682
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,440
But Lu Ke is my man,

683
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,200
and I sent him out.

684
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,480
His affairs are naturally my concern.

685
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,940
The Storm Alliance

686
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,550
was founded by my mother.

687
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,880
I don't believe

688
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,140
she'd establish such rules as flogging.

689
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,110
That's right.

690
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,650
Your mother never set these rules.

691
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,160
If you have resentment,

692
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,880
then blame your father,

693
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,250
who's now in his grave.

694
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,120
He was the one
who tried to exterminate us all.

695
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,480
And now you have the nerve to ask

696
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,140
why people here cannot leave?

697
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,130
Listen carefully:

698
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,720
it's precisely because someone once left

699
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,450
and led your Susha's army here.

700
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,440
This place was nearly razed to the ground!

701
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,300
Anyone can question these rules,

702
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,280
except your Feng family.

703
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,930
You have no right to question them.

704
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,450
Elder Lei,

705
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,720
as I said before,

706
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,480
it might not have been
Feng Pingcheng who ordered

707
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,790
the attack on the alliance.

708
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,450
This matter is still unclear,

709
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,720
so it's premature

710
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,050
to pin this blood feud

711
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,380
on Feng Suige.

712
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
As the Commander-in-Chief
of all Susha armies,

713
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,720
I've reviewed all military intelligence

714
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,110
and battle reports since Susha's founding.

715
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,510
Yet I've never seen any record
of Susha troops

716
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,640
being deployed against the alliance.

717
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,270
If my father had truly given
such an order,

718
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:47,680
there would

719
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,280
definitely be a record of it.

720
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,560
What are you implying?

721
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,640
The one who ordered the siege against you

722
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,040
was likely someone else.

723
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,640
You've harbored this hatred
for so many years,

724
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,500
but I'm afraid you've been hating
the wrong person.

725
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,180
Since you insist on following the rules,

726
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,100
and Lu Ke acted under my orders,

727
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,030
I should be the one

728
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,680
to receive the punishment on his behalf.

729
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,200
No!

730
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,880
Don't you dare do that!

731
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,650
Lei,

732
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,880
these youngsters don't know the rules.

733
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,750
You've already punished him.

734
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,010
Let it go since it's their first offense.

735
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:25,960
Suige.

736
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,960
Elder Lei is a respected senior, after all.

737
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,750
If you apologize,

738
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,000
he'll let it go.

739
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,340
Let's discuss leaving later.

740
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,920
Only those who have done wrong need
to apologize.

741
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,180
What have I done wrong?

742
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,640
Elder Lei,

743
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,350
we will

744
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,450
definitely leave this place.

745
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,200
Good.

746
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,590
I'd like to see

747
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,030
how you leave.

748
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Today, out of respect for Ling Feng,

749
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,730
I'll let you off this time.

750
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,160
If it happens again,

751
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,370
I'll show no mercy!

752
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,880
Feng Suige,

753
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,000
the feud between us is not yet settled.

754
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,110
I'll make you pay for

755
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,510
every single one of them.

756
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:20,560
[Yinghua Palace]

757
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,840
On the day
the late Emperor was assassinated,

758
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,920
Eunuch Ma and the Jinwu Guards on duty

759
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,920
were all killed by the First Prince.

760
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,480
The only witnesses to

761
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,920
the First Prince's regicide

762
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,230
were the Prince of Han

763
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,920
and the Commandery Prince of Yishu.

764
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,719
Your Majesty,

765
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,960
please stop putting me
in a difficult position.

766
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,440
Even if I had

767
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,800
the courage of a lion,

768
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,550
I wouldn't dare ask
the Prince of Han to verify

769
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,630
-the assassination of the late Emperor...
-You mean...

770
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,760
my brother alone, with just one sword,

771
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,909
killed all the Jinwu Guards?

772
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,710
The First Prince was valiant
and skilled in battle,

773
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,590
capable of extraordinary feats.

774
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,190
It's not

775
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,230
entirely impossible.

776
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,510
What about the Imperial Guards
who were patrolling the palace that day?

777
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,000
When my brother fought
with the Jinwu Guards,

778
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,110
there must have been such a commotion—

779
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,960
the Imperial Guards couldn't possibly

780
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,820
have missed it.

781
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,280
It seems

782
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,110
the Imperial Guards were all redeployed.

783
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,000
Redeployed?

784
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,550
By whom?

785
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,880
Why were they moved?

786
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,510
I'm foolish,

787
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,280
and I simply couldn't find out.

788
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,110
Then tell me,

789
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,770
who has the authority to
redeploy the Imperial Guards?

790
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:20,910
Your Majesty,

791
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,670
please stop asking these questions.

792
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,850
If you continue,

793
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,140
my head might not remain on my shoulders.

794
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,850
What if I command you to speak?

795
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,920
On the day the late Emperor
returned to the palace,

796
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,050
he ordered Eunuch Ma

797
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,030
to discipline the Imperial Guards.

798
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,030
Those in the palace who can command
the Imperial Guards

799
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,490
can be counted on one hand.

800
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,760
Very few people...

801
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,560
Other than the Murong family, the only one

802
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,570
who can mobilize the Imperial Guards

803
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,640
is my mother, the Empress Dowager,

804
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,730
right?

805
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,760
This subject never said such a thing!

806
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,070
This subject knows nothing about this!

807
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,000
This subject truly knows nothing!

808
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,790
You're also speaking up for Feng Suige?

809
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:12,370
[Storm Alliance]

810
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,230
He only came here seeking medical help.

811
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,800
If we

812
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,590
forcibly keep him in the alliance,

813
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,550
he will certainly

814
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,590
do everything in his power

815
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,460
to leave.

816
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,320
Still, we cannot let him leave!

817
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,800
That's how I see it.

818
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,840
Our Storm Alliance is

819
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,290
[Storm Alliance]

820
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,730
a shelter for all under heaven,

821
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,110
not a prison!

822
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,190
But every rule established

823
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,530
has its reason.

824
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,310
Not allowing people to leave

825
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,320
is also to protect our alliance.

826
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,960
It's precisely because every one of us
follows the rules

827
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,620
that we remain safe and sound!

828
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,460
Say no more.

829
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,560
Feng Suige cannot be an exception.

830
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,000
Otherwise, in the future,

831
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,660
wouldn't anyone be able to leave
as they please?

832
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,230
Your Highness...

833
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,890
Your Highness,

834
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,160
please don't worry.

835
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,710
After years of
fighting through life and death,

836
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,800
I've suffered all sorts of injuries.

837
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,030
This little injury is
like a mosquito bite.

838
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,550
Lord Ling

839
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,030
doesn't even bother to come treat me.

840
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,670
It'll heal in a couple of days.

841
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,920
All right, hush now.

842
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,360
Okay.

843
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,110
You've been here for so long.

844
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
Have you ever tried to leave before?

845
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,170
I was worried about you before.

846
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,630
I did think about

847
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,430
going to Yujing City to find you.

848
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,320
But firstly, because of the bond contract,

849
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,050
I didn't dare risk your safety.

850
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:25,830
Secondly,

851
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,670
I had joined the Storm Alliance.

852
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,470
I didn't want to become a traitor

853
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
who breaks faith.

854
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,160
Given Elder Lei's attitude today,

855
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,710
it seems that leaving this place

856
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,840
won't be easy at all.

857
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,510
Elder Zhou, you're here.

858
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,570
Hello, Elder Zhou.

859
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,990
Lu Ke is injured.

860
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,550
I've come to check on him.

861
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,390
How do you feel?

862
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,480
You shouldn't have troubled yourself

863
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,800
over such a little injury of mine.

864
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,670
It's not that serious.

865
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,230
I've brought you some

866
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,110
oral medicine.

867
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,570
It'll help with blood circulation
and reduce bruising.

868
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,070
That's great.

869
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,670
Thank you.

870
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,530
It's my fault for being careless.

871
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,320
I should have told you
the rules of this place earlier.

872
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,140
So you

873
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:07,760
wouldn't have suffered

874
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,290
this physical punishment.

875
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,140
Elder Zhou,

876
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,510
we want to leave.

877
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,440
Is there really no way

878
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,640
to make an exception?

879
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,590
Elder Lei initially agreed to save him

880
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,800
out of respect
for the former Alliance Leader.

881
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,320
Now that he's been saved,

882
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,840
it can be said
Elder Lei has done more than enough.

883
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,670
So how could he possibly

884
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,530
let you break the alliance rules?

885
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,440
You know

886
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,810
Elder Lei's character.

887
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,060
Getting him to change his mind

888
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,810
is next to impossible.

889
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,710
You mean

890
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,190
as long as Elder Lei agrees,

891
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,230
we can leave?

892
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,760
Yes.

893
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,190
In the Storm Alliance,

894
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,630
there are four of us elders,

895
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,690
but really, he calls the shots.

896
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,320
If you stay here,

897
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
it won't be so bad.

898
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,150
This place has beautiful scenery,

899
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,750
and most importantly,
it's safe and peaceful.

900
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,730
We have to leave.

901
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,930
There's still so much to do.

902
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,290
Do you really have to leave?

903
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,190
We have to.

904
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,590
I understand.

905
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,070
Where the heart finds peace,

906
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,280
even a humble dwelling becomes paradise.

907
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,670
When the heart is trapped,

908
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,480
even a utopia becomes a cage.

909
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,250
Since you're determined to leave,

910
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,380
I suppose you won't change your mind.

911
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,040
Of course.

912
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,850
That makes things difficult.

913
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,840
I have something to ask,

914
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,570
though I'm not sure if I should.

915
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,520
Please ask, Elder Zhou.

916
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,870
I've long heard

917
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,230
that you're known as
the Killer God of Susha.

918
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,070
You must be someone

919
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,630
who's decisive and ruthless.

920
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,760
Now that you're insisting on leaving,

921
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,030
will you carve a bloody path out?

922
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,630
Elder Zhou, you're worried

923
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,670
that I might go on

924
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,050
a killing spree here in order to leave?

925
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,960
I hope you'll be honest with me.

926
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,480
But don't worry—

927
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,130
whatever you tell me

928
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,480
won't leave this place.

929
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,960
If I wanted to harm you,

930
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,710
I wouldn't have saved you
in the first place.

931
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,480
Please rest assured, Elder Zhou.

932
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,340
The Storm Alliance saved my life.

933
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,640
I won't kill anyone.

934
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,480
Do you mean that?

935
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,000
Not even those in the alliance

936
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,400
who hate you to the core

937
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,970
and want to take your life—

938
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,540
you will not harm them?

939
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:20,830
That's right.

940
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,380
I'm a man of my word.

941
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,150
In that case,

942
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,240
then I can rest easy.

943
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:42,840
How did it go?

944
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,350
I've already tested him.

945
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,070
Feng Suige

946
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,640
won't agree to kill Lei Lie.

947
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,550
I don't understand either.

948
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,440
This guy carries a deep blood feud.

949
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,480
He should stop at nothing

950
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,360
for revenge.

951
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,150
He shouldn't have hesitated at all

952
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,840
to kill Lei Lie,
who has a grudge against him.

953
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,500
It turns out

954
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,360
I had completely misjudged him.

955
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:00,840
Zhou Hao,

956
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,070
you promised

957
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,230
to help me get revenge.

958
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:03,920
Even if your plan

959
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,880
to use Feng Suige falls through,

960
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,320
you absolutely can't go back on your word.

961
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,880
Then you can't hesitate anymore.

962
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,230
We can only  kill Lei Lie ourselves.

963
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,920
What are you still thinking about?
We're running out of time!

964
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,630
Feng Suige has only just recovered

965
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,160
and is still somewhat weak.

966
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,920
Dongshi,

967
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,080
if we don't kill him now,

968
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,280
once he fully recovers,

969
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,810
we won't be able to kill him.

970
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,110
You kill Lei Lie
and take control of the alliance,

971
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,970
and I'll help you kill Feng Suige.

972
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,400
I can't wait any longer!

973
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,960
With my talents in both strategy
and combat,

974
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,440
how could I possibly

975
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,820
live in these mountains

976
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,540
and never get out?

977
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,240
Since you won't help me,

978
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,670
I'll do it myself!

979
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,670
But there's one thing

980
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,800
I need to remind you of.

981
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,730
Once Feng Suige leaves this place,

982
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:55,840
you will never

983
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,640
have another chance for revenge
in your lifetime.

984
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,000
Can you swear...

985
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,840
that you'll definitely kill him?

986
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,710
Of course.

987
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,320
Your enemy is my enemy.

988
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:13,840
Good.

989
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,280
When do we act?

990
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,510
Tonight.

991
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,110
His Majesty specifically ordered

992
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,590
that all the dowry sent from Susha

993
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,050
be given to Your Highness.

994
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,370
