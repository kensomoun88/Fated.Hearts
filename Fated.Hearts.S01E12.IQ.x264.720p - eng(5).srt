00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,800
[Fated Hearts]

2
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:44,030
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,590
Such rash actions

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,000
harm royal dignity.

5
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,229
This matter must be strictly investigated,

6
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,270
or the people will not accept it,

7
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,220
nor will the court officials.

8
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,840
Actually,

9
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,430
Prime Minister Zhuang's argument
is not without logic.

10
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,670
You are a bit too bold.

11
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,680
Even if you've guessed my intentions

12
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,050
and acted decisively,

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,230
couldn't you have

14
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,080
consulted with me beforehand?

15
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,310
Since it's all for the sake of
the kingdom,

16
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:09,870
I...

17
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,630
can hardly rebuke you.

18
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,310
Mr. Ma, a reply from Jinxiu.

19
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,170
You may go.

20
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,700
Your Majesty,

21
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,800
the Emperor of Jinxiu has replied.

22
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,550
To the Emperor of Susha,

23
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:55,030
the Prince of Zhennan
is of noble Jinxiu lineage,

24
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,690
with unparalleled status

25
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,490
and impeccable character.

26
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Your Majesty has shown great discernment,

27
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,000
and I shall not
let this precious gem be tarnished.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,030
The Prince of Zhennan's marriage
to your princess

29
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,800
will surely become a timeless tale.

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,190
If we can resolve
military conflicts through this,

31
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,580
the princess and her husband
will have rendered great service.

32
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,150
I will be greatly comforted.

33
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,590
Enclosed are
Jinxiu's royal genealogy records

34
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,400
and the prince's birth date
as engagement gifts.

35
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,050
May we maintain good relations

36
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,750
and harmony
between our families and kingdoms.

37
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,280
Regarding the matter
of marrying into your family,

38
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,140
I gladly give my blessing.

39
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,620
Your Majesty, what does this mean?

40
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,290
Don't you understand?

41
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,350
Make him understand.

42
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,920
"Regarding the matter
of marrying into your family,

43
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,770
I gladly give my blessing."

44
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,020
Congratulations, Your Majesty,
on gaining a son-in-law!

45
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,550
May auspicious cranes and dragons fly
with heaven's blessing!

46
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,260
-Congratulations, Your Majesty!
-Congratulations, Your Majesty!

47
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,510
Congratulations, Your Majesty,

48
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,910
on gaining a son-in-law.

49
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,960
May auspicious cranes and dragons fly

50
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,700
with heaven's blessing.

51
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,420
Your Highness!

52
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,020
We cannot agree to this.

53
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,180
Your Highness,

54
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,110
this is all Feng Suige's plot.

55
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,170
We absolutely cannot agree to
the matrilocal marriage.

56
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,520
How did you learn about this?

57
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,180
Everyone is talking about it.

58
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,170
At the inn,

59
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,330
even the coachmen and servants know.

60
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,150
The news shouldn't have spread so quickly.

61
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,310
It must be Feng Suige

62
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,160
who deliberately leaked the information.

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,120
He wants to publicly humiliate
His Highness

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,380
and humiliate Jinxiu.

65
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,020
I can't stand

66
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,390
this humiliation anymore!

67
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,950
I'll pack our things and we'll leave.

68
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,650
Leave?

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,480
Where to?

70
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,720
Back to Pingling City.

71
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680
If we don't leave tonight,

72
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,410
by tomorrow, the news

73
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,540
will spread throughout Yujing City,

74
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,750
and then we'll never be able to return.

75
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,010
It's already too late.

76
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,260
The Emperor has already agreed.

77
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,940
If I leave now,

78
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,310
won't I become the one who ruins

79
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,900
the marriage alliance
between the kingdoms?

80
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,300
If Your Highness stays in Susha long-term,

81
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,300
the Emperor can justifiably

82
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,160
take back control of Pingling City.

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,360
Why wouldn't he do so?

84
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,060
What should we do then?

85
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,120
Feng Suige's strategy is an open trap.

86
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,350
There's no way to counter this.

87
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,350
He's anticipated every situation.

88
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,250
He knows

89
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,270
that Your Highness

90
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,070
has no choice but to stay in Susha

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,650
as a son-in-law.

92
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,870
You can't agree to this, Your Highness.

93
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,130
You absolutely can't.

94
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,860
If we leave tonight,

95
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,230
what about rescuing Yixiao?

96
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,960
What I mean is

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,159
we should leave with Yixiao together.

98
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:54,770
Enough.

99
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,650
Things have come to this point.
We can't fight fate.

100
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,200
This marriage
was bound to happen eventually.

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,170
Moreover, our marriage

102
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,440
is greatly important to Jinxiu.

103
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,980
Becoming a son-in-law
doesn't just humiliate me.

104
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,180
It also affects the Emperor's dignity.

105
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,160
I'll keep this in mind.

106
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,730
He'll pay for it later.

107
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,540
Your Highness,

108
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,430
what if we let Feng Suige believe

109
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,080
that we're leaving

110
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,270
Yujing tonight?

111
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,190
Why are you bringing him up?

112
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,590
He must be secretly celebrating right now.

113
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,260
If I were Feng Suige,

114
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,750
I would keep Yixiao under house arrest.

115
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,530
Because if someday

116
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,800
we decided to go down fighting

117
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,810
and leave Yujing,

118
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,900
we might take Yixiao with us.

119
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,050
Yixiao staying at Zhengnian Hall

120
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,310
is ultimately unsafe.

121
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,070
She could fall into

122
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,130
Feng Suige's hands again at any time.

123
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:50,750
Here.

124
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,050
You two,

125
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,260
go to Zhengnian Hall now
and stay with her.

126
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,500
The current situation is sensitive.

127
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,580
I must stay here

128
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,510
to avoid giving others grounds
for criticism in the future.

129
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,270
-Yes.
-Yes.

130
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,690
(Rice Cake)

131
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,330
Your Highness.

132
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,830
All the people around have left?

133
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,390
Yes.

134
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,870
The enemies won't be alerted.

135
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,870
But Your Highness,

136
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,950
how can you be certain

137
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,430
that Xia Jingshi

138
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,850
will definitely act tonight?

139
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,010
[Inn]

140
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,360
Jinxiu's messenger
just entered the city today

141
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,680
and Xia Jingshi has already left
the pharmacy

142
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,010
and returned to the inn.

143
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,720
I believe he already knows about

144
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,600
the reply from the Emperor of Jinxiu.

145
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,580
With his power alone,

146
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,310
he can't change the situation.

147
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,920
If he wants to escape from Susha,

148
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,580
he must have someone help him.

149
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,980
And he will definitely come
to find him personally.

150
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,800
[Zhengnian Hall]

151
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,480
Xueying,

152
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,810
there's sleeping gas!

153
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,150
Sister!

154
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,150
Protect the children!

155
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,680
Alright.

156
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,010
Yixiao!

157
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,440
Sister, the children are all safe.

158
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,630
After him!

159
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,390
Sir.

160
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,130
Please come in.

161
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,120
Who exactly

162
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,510
is Xia Jingshi meeting?

163
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,040
In my opinion,

164
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,100
it's most likely Prime Minister Zhuang.

165
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,390
Before today,

166
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,840
I also thought

167
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,240
this person would be
Prime Minister Zhuang.

168
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,750
But Fu Yixiao

169
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,220
gave me a new idea.

170
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,790
After the Battle of Pingling, this person

171
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,720
disguised as a merchant

172
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,870
and sneaked into Jinxiu's military camp

173
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,270
to meet secretly with Xia Jingshi.

174
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,150
Then it couldn't possibly be
Prime Minister Zhuang

175
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,440
but someone else.

176
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,270
We can't worry about all that now.

177
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,240
We must find this person

178
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,840
today.

179
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,730
Your Highness!

180
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,720
There's trouble at the pharmacy.

181
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,510
The pharmacy is in trouble,

182
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,270
yet you have time to come here?

183
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,320
Why aren't you helping?

184
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,380
I told Gu Yu to come

185
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,840
and report everything
to His Highness first.

186
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,440
Lu Ke,

187
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,490
keep watching Xia Jingshi.

188
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,060
Yun Fang,

189
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,200
send men to surround the teahouse.

190
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,380
Gu Yu, come with me.

191
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,320
Let's go.

192
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,810
Split up and chase him!

193
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,100
Go help Yixiao!

194
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,790
You be careful.

195
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,240
Hurry!

196
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,320
Who are you?

197
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,000
Why do you want to kill Yixiao?

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Seems I won't be able to leave today.

199
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,390
Why would someone

200
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,320
in Yujing City want to harm you?

201
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,010
How would I know?

202
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,870
Are you hiding something

203
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,770
from us?

204
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,130
It's you all
who are hiding things from me.

205
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,450
Explain yourself.

206
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,440
What have we hidden from you?

207
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,500
You know very well.

208
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,960
I won't argue with you today.

209
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,400
Let's chase the assassin first.

210
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,020
Yixiao!

211
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,150
Why?

212
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,700
Yixiao,

213
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,470
I'm sorry.

214
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,590
Why are you doing this to me?

215
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,840
We are

216
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,300
brothers who faced
life and death together!

217
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,120
Yixiao,

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,930
I have no choice.

219
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,440
For Jinxiu,

220
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,240
I have no choice!

221
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,990
I've suspected anyone.

222
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,240
How could it possibly be you?

223
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,020
Why are you doing this to me?

224
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,850
Why would you do this?

225
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,230
Our lives

226
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,620
have long ceased to belong to ourselves.

227
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,480
Yixiao.

228
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,440
You go ahead.

229
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,410
When I finish what I need to do,

230
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,400
I'll join you in the afterlife.

231
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,040
What I owe you,

232
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,260
I'll repay in the next life.

233
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,340
Take this.

234
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,360
What is this?

235
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,700
This is my mercy as a prince.

236
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,460
So you were prepared all along.

237
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,460
I was right.

238
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,150
You've already remembered

239
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,350
who wants to kill you.

240
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,270
Xia Jingshi shot me down with an arrow,

241
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,120
simply because I heard

242
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,200
what I shouldn't have heard.

243
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,840
What exactly happened

244
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,910
in that tent that day?

245
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,390
And who was that so-called merchant?

246
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,030
What are you really planning?

247
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,230
All you need to know is

248
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,980
everything is for Jinxiu!

249
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,890
Am I not

250
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,880
a citizen of Jinxiu too?

251
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,080
Am I not your brother?

252
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,890
Would I really

253
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,440
betray Jinxiu?

254
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,670
I've risked my life

255
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,210
for Jinxiu all these years.

256
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,680
What plan could possibly

257
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,360
make you so determined to kill me?

258
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,490
Stop asking!

259
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,160
Everything I've done

260
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,910
was for Jinxiu,

261
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,870
for His Highness!

262
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,950
I, Ning Fei...

263
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,420
I, Fu Yixiao...

264
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,780
I, Xiao Weiran...

265
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,640
With tea in place of wine,

266
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,760
hereby become sworn brothers.

267
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,750
We may not have been born
on the same day...

268
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,620
But we vow to die on the same day.

269
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,350
Go!

270
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
She told you to go.

271
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,120
Did I say you could leave?

272
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,590
You know

273
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,240
I never agreed to this marriage alliance.

274
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,300
Jinxiu Military Advisor Xiao Weiran

275
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,330
deliberately attempted to harm my family.

276
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,560
I can't let

277
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,570
such a good opportunity slip away.

278
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,270
Will you surrender

279
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,760
or fight to the death?

280
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,480
Your choice.

281
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,870
Come, this way please.

282
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,030
Where's the customer

283
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,350
who just went upstairs?

284
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,210
He's upstairs.

285
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,750
Hey.

286
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,780
Hurry!

287
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,600
Where is he?

288
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,350
Speak up! Where is he?

289
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,070
Speak? He escaped through the back door.

290
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,780
Where is he?

291
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,540
[Hongfu Pewterware]

292
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,580
Your Highness,

293
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,590
please punish me.

294
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,640
I lost him.

295
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,940
Your Highness,

296
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,790
when I went in,

297
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,640
I saw Xia Jingshi

298
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,590
going upstairs.

299
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,660
He couldn't have done this alone.

300
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,960
He must have had help.

301
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,650
Do you mean

302
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,360
someone helped him escape?

303
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,680
Otherwise, how would a prince from Jinxiu

304
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,290
know which teahouse
in Susha's Yujing Capital

305
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,760
has a back door?

306
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,270
Your Highness, don't worry.

307
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,200
I'll lead men to search right away.

308
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,090
We'll definitely catch him.

309
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:26,960
No need to search.

310
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,580
Before you even begin,

311
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,000
he probably will have already

312
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,590
returned to the inn unscathed.

313
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,110
However, tonight

314
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,840
wasn't completely fruitless.

315
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,440
Just now, Xiao Weiran
tried to kill Fu Yixiao.

316
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,270
The fox has shown its tail.

317
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,980
Go interrogate him

318
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,820
and deliver a message from me.

319
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,510
Yes.

320
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,200
Being so cautious,

321
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,270
seems like you're afraid of Feng Suige.

322
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,710
Shouldn't you be

323
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,530
the one being cautious?

324
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,010
I can't stay in Susha anymore.

325
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,320
I must go back.

326
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,830
After the wedding,

327
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,900
I'll find a way

328
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,300
to help you leave Yujing.

329
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,270
However,

330
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,780
what do you plan to do with that woman?

331
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,900
She's lost her memory.

332
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,510
She won't be a threat.

333
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,300
Who can be certain about that?

334
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,510
There's no guarantee

335
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,240
she won't remember something.

336
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,660
I've already killed her once.

337
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,720
I will never

338
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,020
kill her again.

339
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,860
I'll bring her back to Jinxiu.

340
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,640
Also,

341
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,680
after your plan starts,

342
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,640
the secret will no longer be a secret.

343
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,240
Anyway,

344
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,400
she can't die.

345
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,970
Your Highness,

346
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,130
are you certain?

347
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,580
What do you mean?

348
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,940
Xiao Weiran
failed to assassinate Fu Yixiao.

349
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,400
He has now fallen

350
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,800
into Feng Suige's hands.

351
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,130
Let me remind you.

352
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,590
If you don't want to be
trapped here forever,

353
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,960
stay calm

354
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,400
and don't act rashly.

355
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,460
Don't sacrifice yourself

356
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,490
for someone like Xiao Weiran.

358
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,890

What will you do to Xiao Weiran?

365
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,930
I captured him.

366
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,480
How I deal with him
is none of your business.

367
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,880
Of course it concerns me.

368
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,750
He is my brother.

369
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,640
I wanted to let him go.

370
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,440
Why did you capture him?

371
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,770
Where is he being held?

372
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,170
In the dungeon?

373
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,220
Since he's in my custody,

374
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,910
♪ The world is vast and far ♪

375
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,090
let me handle this.

376
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,850
I'm the one involved.

377
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,660

00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,240
hijacked and burned a merchant ship,

470
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,700

We haven't

472
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,680

you managed to get an entire ship of oil.

475
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,790
There must be someone

476
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,850
in Yujing City secretly helping you.

477
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,640
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

478
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,400
It doesn't matter if you don't confess.

479
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,700
We have plenty of time.

480
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,950

We know you're tough.

483
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,890
His Highness said,

484
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,860
for you,

485
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,270
it's imprisonment without trial,

486
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,880
confinement without execution.

487
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,010
What does that mean?

488
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,880
What exactly do you mean?

489
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,000
Did you say what I told you to?

490
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,870
How did he react?

491
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,400
It seems the ship burning incident

492
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,200
is definitely connected to him.

493
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,500
That's right.

494
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,620
Besides Xia Jingshi,

495
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,720
only he can mobilize
Jinxiu's undercover guards.

496
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,580
Your Highness,

497
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,240
the marriage alliance
is about to take place.

498
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,510
Now that we've captured Xiao Weiran,

499
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,310
won't Xia Jingshi

500
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:07,960
make a fuss

501
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,860
with this?

502
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,240
Making a fuss
will only hinder the marriage alliance,

503
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,920
which isn't what he wants to see.

504
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,050
Then isn't he afraid

505
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,750
Xiao Weiran might be forced to confess?

506
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,750
He knows Xiao Weiran won't confess.

507
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,370
And we don't need his confession anyway.

508
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,110
Then I'm even more confused.

509
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,200
Your Highness, you clearly know

510
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,250
he won't say anything,

511
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,450
yet you still keep him imprisoned here.

512
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,880
Do you want to

513
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,110
force him to commit suicide?

514
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,110
Just because we can't get him to talk

515
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,240
doesn't mean others can't.

516
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,010
Why are you doing this to me?

517
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,550
We are

524
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,720

What about Weiran?

530
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,050
Is he here with you too?

531
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,330
He plotted to kill Yixiao,

532
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,310
so I locked him up.

533
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,590
Stop talking nonsense.

534
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,880
I don't care what tricks you're playing.

535
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
You must hand them

536
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,810
over to me today.

537
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,090
Otherwise, I'll...

538
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,240
Otherwise what?

539
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,440
I see that besides talking big,

540
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,040
you only have brute strength

541
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,830
and no other use.

542
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,880
No wonder even your own brother

543
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,670
manipulates you.

544
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,960
What are you saying?

545
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,810
You should recognize

546
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,710
this waist token, right?

547
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
How did you get this?

548
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,310
This was found on

549
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,110
an assassin's body in the forest

550
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,040
where Fu Yixiao fell off the cliff.

551
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,880
Assassin?

552
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
After Fu Yixiao fell off the cliff,

553
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,110
she was attacked by assassins.

554
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,020
You didn't know?

555
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,170
You're lying.

556
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,720
Yixiao fell off the cliff by accident.

557
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,870
Who told you that?

558
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,550
Someone saw it with their own eyes

559
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,680
that His Highness and Weiran...

560
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,750
Why should I tell you?

561
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,550
With her skills,
how could she accidentally fall?

562
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,100
Perhaps she had too much to drink.

563
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,020
I think Xia Jingshi

564
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,350
keeps you around

565
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,400
for entertainment.

566
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:14,980
Hey!

567
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,930
The wound on Fu Yixiao's shoulder

568
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,480
was from an arrow shot within five steps

569
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,240
of her.

570
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,520
She was completely unprepared,

571
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,440
which means the archer

572
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,790
was someone she trusted.

573
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,830
Later, I found her

574
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,350
at Zhengnian Villa

575
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,880
and brought her back to Yujing.

576
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,200
Along the way, Jinxiu's undercover guards

577
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,480
were waiting for an opportunity,

578
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,350
and they knew

579
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,000
they couldn't make a move in Yujing City.

580
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,400
That's why they used those children

581
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,210
to force her to show herself.

582
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,510
Haven't you thought about any of this?

583
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,790
This...

584
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,730
And who can mobilize

585
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,160
these Jinxiu underover guards?

586
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,260
I don't need to tell you this.

587
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,060
You should already know, right?

588
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,140
Feng Suige,

589
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,500
don't think that I'll believe you

590
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,490
by playing these tricks.

591
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,620
If you don't believe me, go ask Yixiao.

592
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,480
I will.

602
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,570
What's wrong, Yixiao?

603
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,340

Yixiao.

605
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,940
Feng Suige just told me

606
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,350
that Weiran wanted to harm you.

607
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,580
What exactly happened?

608
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,870
You can't believe what Feng Suige says.

609
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,270
He must be trying to
sow discord between us.

610
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,200
Yixiao, you can't stay here.

611
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,680
Let's go find His Highness.

612
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,880
Are you done talking?

613
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,940
If so, then go back.

Impossible!

617
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,170
What Feng Suige said wasn't true.

618
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,100
There must be a misunderstanding!

619
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,550
Yixiao,

620
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,219
I'll ask His Highness to clarify.

621
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,670
I'll definitely
get to the bottom of this.

are you reproaching me?

659

I was just making a casual remark.

Can't I even make

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,410
a joke anymore?

for me to marry the Prince of Zhennan,

669
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,150
I feel grateful.

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,800
I shouldn't be the one to say this.

Brother, why are you doing this?

675
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,360
Are you referring to

676
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,220
making him marry into our family?

677
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,060
He can stay with his family

678
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,860
and marry the person he loves.

679
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,550
Isn't that the best outcome?

680

But after all,

681
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,230
he is the Prince of Zhennan from Jinxiu.

682
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,960
This marriage alliance

683

is not only a matter between our kingdoms

684
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,710

between him and me.

752
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,320
please make yourself

753
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
comfortable and at ease

754
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,510
in this residence.

755
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,400
This...

756
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,010
Prime Minister Zhuang also said

757
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,250
you should not be troubled by this.

758
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,920
The wedding is the priority.

759
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,060
After the wedding,

760
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,770
everything might change.

761
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,340
[Jingming Garden]

762
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,160
I am your sister.

763
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,760
We have the same parents.

764
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,670
How could you take advantage

765
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,740
of even my wedding?

766
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,710
He's the one who will
accompany me forever!

767
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,400
In this world,

768
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,840
he'll be the only one

769
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,230
to remain by my side forever.

770
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,760
How am I supposed to face him

771
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,220
and explain in the future?

772
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,480
Brother,

773
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,670
you really

774
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,070
disappointed me.

775
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,450
Your Highness.

776
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,590
What is it?

777
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,550
Xia Jingshi has already moved into

778
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,580
the royal villa.

779
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,590
That guy would never have imagined

780
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,400
that you would find a way

781
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,430
to detain him in Susha.

782
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,710
I bet even that old fox
Prime Minister Zhuang

783
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,110
is completely helpless.

784
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,270
Have you found the person
who tried to assassinate Yixiao?

785
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,550
His identity has been confirmed.

786
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,150
It's Lieutenant Xun Xiang
from the North Pass.

787
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,150
By now, Xun Xiang should have

788
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,920
already escaped from Yujing City.

789
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,760
Don't worry.

790
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,360
I've already sent people to capture him.

791
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
He won't get away.

792
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,930
Your Highness,

793
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,190
I just can't figure this out.

794
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,900
Why would Xun Xiang

795
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,580
want to kill Miss Yixiao?

796
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,050
It makes no sense.

797
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,040
He was acting on someone's orders.

798
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,210
Years ago, the Xun family

799
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,000
received favors from Empress Zhuang.

800
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,440
This matter is likely connected

801
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,640
to the Zhuang family.

802
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,450
So the Empress sent someone

803
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,760
to kill Miss Yixiao?

804
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,530
For Prime Minister Zhuang?

805
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,030
Prime Minister Zhuang
instructed the Empress to do this?

806
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,880
For now, we don't need to
ask so many questions.

807
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,360
Once we catch Xun Xiang,
everything will be clear.

808
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
We need him alive.

809
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,400
Understood.

810
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,510
The marriage alliance
is already finalized.

811
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,840
Why did you take such unnecessary action?

812
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,360
I'm just removing obstacles

813
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,690
for Xiyang, that's all.

814
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,760
That female general from Jinxiu

815
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,670
went through life and death
with Xia Jingshi.

816
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,710
They've probably already
fallen for each other.

817
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,380
She's just a female general.

818
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,440
Are you saying Xia Jingshi

819
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,500
won't have concubines in the future?

820
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,390
But in my opinion,

821
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,710
if that woman isn't eliminated,

822
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,590
she'll eventually become a threat.

823
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,320
She's in Yujing City right now.

824
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,630
How could I miss

825
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,710
this opportunity?

826
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,070
You acted rashly.

827
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,030
If Feng Suige notices anything,

828
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,110
the blame will fall on me.

829
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,510
Father, you needn't worry.

830
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,510
That Xun Xiang

831
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,320
comes from the 17th Battalion
of lower ranks.

832
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,310
Nobody pays any attention to him.

833
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,730
He won't be connected

834
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,030
to you in any way.

835
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,230
Anything you do

836
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,560
will be connected to me.

837
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,580
Drop this matter.

838
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,480
Don't act rashly again.

839
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,580
Let me remind you.

840
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,320
If you don't want to be
trapped here forever,

841
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,630
then stay calm

842
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,230
and don't act rashly.

843
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,410
Your Highness,

844
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,070
Princess Xiyang is here.

845
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:51,920
Got it.
