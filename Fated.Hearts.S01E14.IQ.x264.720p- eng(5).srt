00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,880
She was.

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:49,920
And now?

6
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,470

If your mother were still alive,

10
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,150
seeing you so troubled by love,

11
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,840
she would probably laugh at you.

12

How long will you stay?

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,590
Is it for the wedding?

20
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,310
I'm not interested

[Wutong Mansion]

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,079
I locked him up in the patrol unit

35
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,360
precisely to make it easier
for them to rescue him.

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,090
If I'd kept him in my residence,

37
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,100
do you think Prime Minister Zhuang
and his people

38
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,630
would've dared make a move?

39
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,590
But Xia Jingshi

40
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,740
didn't go to get him himself.

41
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,400
He went through the envoys
of the two nations.

At the Ministry of Rites,

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,260
they promised Xia Jingshi

that they would help him
bring Miss Yixiao back.

45
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,720
Xia Jingshi probably thought

46
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,900
it wouldn't work out,

47
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,030

to Xiao Weiran.

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,700
Which means

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,780
Xia Jingshi
has already tacitly acknowledged

51
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,680
that Miss Yixiao

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
isn't your prisoner,

Xiao Weiran switched sides.

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,300
He saw the play couldn't go on,

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,260
so he just dropped the act.

Xia Jingshi
will naturally reassign him elsewhere.

If he stays in Susha,

She didn't say.

With your personality,

102
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,600
you'd have to get to the bottom of it
no matter what.

to see me dead?

107
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,120
I never once thought of

But what about you?

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,680
Didn't you say that with our plan,

121
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,340
we would definitely win
the Battle of Pingling?

122
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,910
You don't need to tell me.

I know it was
that female commander of yours

124
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,120
who ruined our plan with a single arrow.

125
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,500
Since that's the case,

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,120

why don't you execute her

127

128
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,510
What?

You can't bear to do it?

How Yixiao should be punished

132
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,220
is an internal matter
for the Zhennan Army.

133
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,730
It's none of your concern.

134

definitely has ill intentions.

What are you talking about?

154
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,360
You know I wouldn't kill you.

Why are you forcing me?

156

Don't be deceived by that person.

Just let me kill him.

159
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,710
No one deceived me.

160
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,300
This is all my own choice.

161
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,500
Your own choice?

162
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,470
Yixiao,

163
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,580
it's all right.

164
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,620
I know.

165
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,190
I know that you don't understand me now.

166
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,630
You will understand in the future.

167
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,480
Everything I've done

168
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,790
is for our future.

169
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,730
Give me the bow now

170
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,800
and come back with me.

171
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,240
Okay?

172
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,280
Give me the bow!

173
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,200
Whatever your reasons,

174
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,510
you cannot sacrifice

175
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,680
the people of Zhennan Pass!

176
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,340
War always costs lives!

177
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,860
I'm ordering you now

178
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,150
to come back with me!

179
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,570
Soldiers spill blood

180
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,950
and die on the battlefield

181
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,680
so the common people

182
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,800
can live in peace

183
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,160
and avoid slaughter!

184
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,780
But for your own selfish reasons,

185
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,240
you want to sacrifice the lives

186
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,770
of 300,000 civilians at Zhennan Pass!

187
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,180
How could you be so cruel,

188
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,900
so heartless?

189
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,560
I am cruel?

190
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,130
Let me tell you,

191
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,360
if I had the slightest bit of

192
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,400
soft-heartedness,

193
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,120
I, Xia Jingshi,

194
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
wouldn't have lived to see this day.

195
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,030
Yixiao,

196
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,530
I'm begging you.

197
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,080
Just pretend nothing happened.

198
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,440
Pretend you don't know anything.

199
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,300
Go back with me!

200
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,390
I won't go back!

201
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,890
Your Highness,

202
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,360
I'm sorry I cannot obey your orders today.

203
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,910
If you insist on this path,

204
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,400
I'll kill him even if it costs me my life!

205
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,270
Yixiao,

206
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,550
I knew this path

207
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,080
would be full of obstacles,

208
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,600
but I never imagined

209
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,120
you'd become one of them.

210
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,770
I also never imagined

211
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,000
you could be so ruthless.

212
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,360
Fine.

213
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,240
So you really want to do this,

214
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,870
right?

215
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,380
Didn't you just say

216
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,410
everything you had done

217
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,720
is for our future?

218
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,720
Then right now,

219
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,870
I'll act on behalf of my future self

220
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,600
and stop you.

221
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,460
Will you let me?

222
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,660
I have never begged you for anything.

223
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,080
Today,

224
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,630
I'm begging you.

225
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,720
No.

226
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,340
Yixiao!

227
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,290
Put down the bow!

228
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,660

At the Battle of Pingling,

246
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,320
your plan

247
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,720
was to use the lives
of hundreds of thousands

248
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,870
of civilians in the city as bait,

249
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,470
wasn't it?

250
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,510
Once Feng Suige had breached Zhennan Pass,

251
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,040
he would not only have died,

252
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,220
but would also have been branded
with the stigma of a city massacre.

253
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,560
Of course he must die.

254
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,150
Only his death

255
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,040
can throw Susha into utter chaos.

256
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,270
Only with his death

257
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:12,910
will I one day

258
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,910
be free from fighting on two fronts.

259
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,440
Yixiao,

260
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,720
you must understand that

261
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,240
he is our real enemy.

262
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,000
Are the civilians in that city

263
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,370
your enemies too?

264
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,510
Yes.

265
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,490
So many people can be sacrificed.

266
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,480
I, Fu Yixiao,

267
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,330
just a mere officer of the Zhennan Army—

268
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,120
what does it matter if I die?

269
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,840
I never intended

270
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,520
to kill you.

271
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,270
If that day

272
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,910
I had truly wanted to kill you,

273
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,120
how would that arrow have ended up

274
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
in your shoulder?

275
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,630
Well then,

276
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,270
thank you for not killing me.

277
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,310
Xia Jingshi,

278
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,880
I'm asking you one last time—

279
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,510
who is

280
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,370
the masked man?

281
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,030
Yixiao,

282
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,550
can you

283
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,550
come back to me?

284
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,840
I'm asking who that person is!

285
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,650
Answer me!

286
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,550
I don't expect you to understand me.

287
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,970
I only want to tell you

288
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,750
that I used to think

289
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,670
everything I wanted

290
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,000
was the most important,

291
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,920
but after losing you, I realized

292
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,750
you were what mattered most.

293
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,600
I never truly wanted

294
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,440
to kill you.

295
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,410
Give me another chance.

296
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,890
You still refuse to tell me.

297
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,510
I know.

298
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,810
It was all my fault before.

299
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,670
Whatever happened before,

300
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,270
it was all my fault.

301
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,320
I did everything wrong.

302
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,270
I know that whatever I say now

303
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,040
is useless.

304
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,230
All I ask

305
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,160
is for you to come back to me.

306
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,050
As long as you come back to me,

307
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,450
I'll do anything you ask.

308
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,150
I can give up everything.

309
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,210
We can be like before.

310
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,550
Let's start over.

311
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,870
Let's be together again,

312
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,360
okay?

313
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,320
You look ridiculous now.

314
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,130
No matter what you say,

315
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,980
there's no going back.

316
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,630
When you shot that arrow,

317
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,270
the old Fu Yixiao

318
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,360
was dead.

319
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,120
You killed her yourself.

320
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,240
You once saved me,

321
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,470
but you also killed me yourself.

322
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,960
From now on,

323
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
our debts are settled.

324
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,060
We owe each other nothing.

325
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,550
Next time we meet,

326
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,120
we'll be enemies.

327
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Ning Fei is dead.

328
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,700
Tell Xiao Weiran about it.

329
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,770
Think of it as closure.

330
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,800
I was careless.

331
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,720
I never imagined

332
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,840
you'd choose this moment

333
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,080
to meet Xia Jingshi.

334
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,250
When did you get here?

335
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,600
Looks like

336
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,000

337
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
your grasp after all.

338
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,400
What did he do to you?

339
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,750
Did you two fight?

340
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,690
I'm fine.

341
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,960

342
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,790
What happened to you?

343
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,369
I'm really fine.

344

Don't worry.

345

I was worried you'd have nightmares.

380
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,030
Aren't you going to ask me

381
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,230
what I dreamed about?

382
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,680
I can guess.

383
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,350
Those dreams aren't scary at all.

384
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,010
I couldn't see colors in them,

385
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,800
so I knew they were just dreams.

386
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,630
I remember...

387
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,110
I had just left

388
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,660
Xia Jingshi's.

389
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,300
You were probably just too tired.

390
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,670
You fell asleep

391
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,920
as soon as you left Xia Jingshi's.

392
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,090
I fell asleep?

393
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,550
Yes.

394
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,520
You really can sleep anywhere.

395
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,680
You actually fell asleep on the street.

396
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,540
It really scared them at the time.

397
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,160
But I told them not to worry.

398
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,280
You must

399
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,840
have been exhausted.

400
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,850
Exactly. Too tired.

401
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
It's not dawn yet.

402
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,570
Go back to sleep.

403
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,600
I'll keep watch at the door.

404
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,920
You can rest easy.

405
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,290
I'll keep

406
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,920
these candles burning.

407
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,040
There's no need.

408
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,440
I'm fine now.

409
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,010
You should go rest too.

410
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,870
Feng Suige,

411
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:40,800
thank you.

412
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,710
Who told you to provoke her?

413
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,960
Those are just common methods

414
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,980
to treat hysteria.

415
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,750
She has a head injury

416
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,750
and a blood clot in her brain.

417
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,590
Any stimulus

418
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,720
or emotional outburst

419
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,000
could cause her clot

420
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,200
to burst like a flood.

421
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,590
She's having nightmares

422
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,640
because she was

423
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
overstimulated.

424
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,440
If you want her

425
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,570
to live peacefully,

426
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,320
stay away from all the chaos.

427

[Wutong Mansion]

428
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,250
Where are you taking me?

429
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,270
What?

430
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,420
You think I would harm you?

431
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,720
What are you up to?

432
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,590
Whatever it is,

433
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,860
it can't be anything bad.

434
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,350
If you don't tell me,

435
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,000
I won't go.

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,500
[Wutong Mansion]

437
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,020
The wind picked up last night,

438
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,800
and today the sky's full of dark clouds.

439
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,510
I'm worried it might rain

440
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,880
and ruin the herb fields,

441
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,280
so I want to check on them.

442
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,060
It's a long journey.

443
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,070
I just want someone to talk to.

444
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,930
The dignified First Prince of Susha

445
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,110
actually has the leisure

446
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,570
to farm?

447
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,030
What a coincidence.

448
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,180
I'd like to see it.

449
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,070
What are your plans now?

450
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,920
Plans?

451
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,250
Since you left Xia Jingshi,

452
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,240
you're no longer a female general
of Jinxiu.

453
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,830
And if I were to

454
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,830
make you my concubine,

455
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,630
it would seem far too frivolous.

456
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,560
Have you ever thought about

457
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,540
joining me?

458
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,900
Joining you?

459
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,260
What's in it for me?

460
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,920
What's in it for you?

461
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,400
You'll officially work for me.

462
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,550
Whatever happens from now on,

463
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,580
I'll protect you

464
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,180
and keep you safe.

465
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,590
I know

466
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,910
you're trying to find out

467
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,000
what exactly Xia Jingshi

468
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,640
told me.

469
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,310
You can be straightforward.

470
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,350
There's no need to beat around the bush.

471
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,440
That day in the tent,

472
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,830
the one meeting with Xia Jingshi

473
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,920
was a masked man.

474
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,030
Xia Jingshi called him Meng Junran.

475
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,160
No matter how I pressed him,

476
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,620
Xia Jingshi refused
to reveal his identity.

477
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,790
In the Battle of Pingling,

478
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,810
their plan

479
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,870
was to lure you into the city,

480
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
use hundreds of thousands of civilians
as shields,

481
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,580
and wipe out your Feng Battalion.

482
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,700
Use civilians as shields?

483
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,310
If you had broken through Zhennan Pass

484
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,750
and entered Pingling City,

485
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,310
would you have slaughtered the civilians?

486
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,110
Of course not.

487
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,640
What if among the civilians

488
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,310
there were hidden crossbowmen

489
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,620
out to kill you?

490
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,550
When you can't tell the enemy

491
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,760
from the civilians,

492
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
what would you do?

493
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,190
I have to kill them all.

494
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,530
In that case,

495
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,240
you'd become the true culprit
behind the massacre

496
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,000
of hundreds of thousands in Pingling City.

497
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,520
Even if you managed to survive

498
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,650
and return to Susha,

499
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,400
your reputation would be ruined.

500
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,350
Everyone would see you

501
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,810
as a bloodthirsty killer.

502
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,680
What a clever scheme.

503
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,350
It seems that

504
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,920
if not for that arrow
you shot at me that day,

505
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,550
I'd have died

506
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,950
without a proper burial.

507
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,890
I guess it was a blessing in disguise.

508
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,600
By the way,

509
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,130
thank you for the gold-threaded soft armor
you gave me—

510
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,060
it saved my life.

511
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,610
But why didn't you use it yourself?

512
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:13,450
With my martial skills,
I didn't need to wear it.

513
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,240
I know what you're about to say.

514
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,030
That I'm so arrogant,

515
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,120
yet I still ended up defeated by you.

516
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,240
I wasn't thinking that at all.

517
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,070
You said it.

518
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,320
A blessing in disguise, right?

519
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,090
Whose home is this?

520
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,310
Mine.

521
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,030
It's quite similar

522
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,490
to my home in Zhennan Pass.

523
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,780
Looks like

524
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,780
you're not fond of
living in a grand mansion either.

525
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,350
That's my mother's hairpin.

526
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,670
You mean

527
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,720
the former empress of Susha?

528
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,360
This is my mother's private residence.

529
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,970
When she was young,

530
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,960
she often led troops in battles.

531
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Every time she returned from war

532
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,310
and didn't want to go back to the palace,

533
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,160
she would come here

534
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,220
and stay for a while

535
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,370
to escape all those constraints.

536
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,790
I never imagined the former empress
of Susha

537
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,590
was such a free-spirited woman.

538
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,030
My mother always yearned

539
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,690
for a life of freedom and ease.

540
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,800
If it hadn't been for my father,

541
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,070
she would never have trapped herself

542
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,140
within the palace walls.

543
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,270
So...

544
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,400
you once lived here too?

545
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,830
When I was little,

546
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,680
I often stayed here with my mother.

547
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,480
There were no palace rules here—

548
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,680
just freedom and joy.

549
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,920
She would spend her days with us

550
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,080
planting herbs

551
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,730
and tending flowers here.

552
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,920
Sometimes when my father came,

553
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,620
he'd take me and Xiyang

554
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,500
to the stream to catch fish.

555
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:23,960
Hug it.

556

no one knew

Why do they want to kill you?

576
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:08,960
You already know the answers

577
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,290
to these two questions.

578
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,550
According to our previous agreement,

579
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,310
our cooperation

580
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,240
ends here.

581
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,610
I said before

582
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,640
that if you want to leave,

583
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,560
I won't force you to stay.

584
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,650
You brought me here

585
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,480
just to tell me this?

586
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,830
Yes.

587
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,850
But not exactly.

588
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,290
Then what is it?

589
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,640
Stop beating around the bush.

590
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,480
Just say it.

591
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:46,960
Whatever

592
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,280
Xia Jingshi's plan is,

593
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,810
it only targets Susha

594
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,640
and me.

595
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,630
It has nothing to do with you.

596
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,330
If you're willing,

597
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,000
I can find you

598
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,360
a place with beautiful scenery to live in.

599
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,730
You can take those children with you too.

600
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,830
So you don't want me to help you find

601
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,070
that masked man?

602
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
Even without you,

603
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,190
I can find him on my own.

604
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,540
Feng Suige,

605
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,530
you seem

606
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,620
rather unfamiliar today.

607
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,380
Your sudden concern for me

608
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,010
makes me a bit scared.

609
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
What are you up to?

610
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,660
What purpose can I have?

611
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,000
Whatever your purpose,

612
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,590
you clearly don't have good intentions.

613
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,220
Feng Suige,

614
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:45,830
since the day

615
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,920
you arrested me,

616
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,180
I've wanted to tell you

617
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,220
that even though you hold every advantage

618
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,550
and seem certain to win,

619
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,270
you will never

620
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,160
beat me.

621
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,560
Why?

622
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,110
Because I always know

623
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,350
what you're thinking.

624
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,930
There's quite a big fish here.

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,210
She's having nightmares

633
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,880
because she was

634
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,370
overstimulated.

635
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,780
♪ My eyes ♪

636
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,240

to live peacefully,

638
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,160

645
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,050
Your Highness.

646
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,420
We found Xun Xiang.

647
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,710
Lu Ke is watching him.

648
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,679
I see.

649
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,710
When she wakes,

650
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,850
escort her back to the residence.

651
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,110
Be extremely careful.

652
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:47,960
Yes.

653
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,390
When you planned to kill,

654
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,670
did you ever think about your daughter?

655
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,000
Do you plan to surrender,

656
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,360
or should I have your whole family
arrested

657
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,490
to keep you company?

658
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,200
Get in!

659
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,340
Your Highness,

660
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,070
the Xun family
is distantly related to the Empress.

661
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,960
Aren't we being

662
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,190
a bit too conspicuous?

663
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,100
Fu Yixiao is under my protection.

664
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,840
I want everyone in Yujing City

665
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,400
to know about this.

666
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,860
Whoever dares to harm her,

667
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,670
I will kill them.

668
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,200
Your Majesty, I came

669
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,360
to report something important.

670
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,920
Recently, someone actually

671
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,400
attempted to assassinate
a member of my household.

672
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,030
We've caught the culprit.

673
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,740
He's outside the hall.

674
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,190
Are the Ministry of Justice

675
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,960
and the Court of Judicial Review
both closed?

676
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,920
If someone tries to assassinate you,

677
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,070
just go to them.

678
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,930
What do you mean by bringing the assassin

679
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,210
into the palace?

680
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,440
It's because this person
has a special identity.

681
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,000
I have no authority to handle him.

682
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I request Your Majesty's judgment.

683
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,920
Lu Ke.

684
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,480
Kneel!

685
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,110
Your Majesty, spare me!

686
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,440
Your Majesty, spare me!

687
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,710
Is this the child from the Xun family?

688
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,630
Yes.

689
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,920
Your Majesty, you remember

690
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
the Empress's relatives

691
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,070
very well.

692
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,660
Are you saying

693
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,320
that this person's
assassination attempt at your residence

694
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,920
is connected to the Empress?

695
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,970
Your Majesty, you are wise.

696
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,060
The truth and justice

697
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,950
rest entirely on your judgment.

698
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,150
I'm afraid the Empress already knows

699
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,190
that I brought Xun Xiang

700
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,120
into the palace.

701
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,320
As for how deeply

702
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,550
she is involved,

703
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,320
Your Majesty,

704
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,680
please wait and see.

705
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,320
You seem quite confident.

706
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,980
Greetings, Your Majesty.

707
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,510
Your Majesty.

708
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,550
First Prince,

709
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,800
you brought someone covered in blood

710
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,960
before His Majesty.

711
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,590
If it startled His Majesty,

712
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,450
what punishment would befit you?

713
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,360
His Majesty is a warrior emperor

714
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,280
who has expanded our territories

715
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,880
and achieved unparalleled merit.

716
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,740
He will not be startled so easily.

717
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,290
Empress,

718
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,230
why are you here?

719
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,590
I heard today that

720
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,960
the First Prince
entered the palace unexpectedly

721
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,780
and feared he might displease you again.

722
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,320
His Majesty didn't sleep well last night

723
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,050
and woke up dizzy this morning.

724
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,510
First Prince,

725
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,670
please speak to His Majesty patiently.

726
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,270
Don't upset him.

727
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,030
Your Majesty,

728
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,800
I truly admire

729
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,690
your concern for His Majesty.

730
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,320
However,

731
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,250
you may not know,

732
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,380
but General Xun

733
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,190
has already confessed everything.

734
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,630
I don't understand

735
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,850
what First Prince is saying.

736
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,800
But if I weren't here today,

737
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,270
some matters

738
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,600
might have been impossible to clarify.

739
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,150
Our Zhuang family and the Xun family
are only distant relatives,

740
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,810
with very little connection.

741
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,330
I don't know

742
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,510
how Xun Xiang offended

743
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,840
the First Prince today.

744
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,350
But no matter what the Xun family
has done,

745
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,870
I am unaware.

746
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,800
How this matter should be handled

747
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,590
is for Your Majesty to decide.

748
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,210
Although I'm not welcomed in Yujing,

749
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,360
everything should follow the principle

750
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,150
of fair rewards and punishments.

751
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,280
Otherwise, how can I continue

752
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,530
living here?

753
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,060
First Prince,

754
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,900
when has His Majesty ever let you

755
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,230
suffer any injustice?

756
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,050
-Isn't this...
-Empress.

757
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,160
This is not the harem.

758
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,900
I'll talk to you

759
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,630
when I get back.

760
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,970
You may leave now.

761
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

762
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,320
I know you suspect the Empress

763
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,450
of involvement,

764
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,700
but you have no solid evidence.

765
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,570
Didn't he say nothing at all?

766
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,390
Does it matter

767
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,760
whether he did or not?

768
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,260
I am truly innocent...

769
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,440
Xiyang is about to be married.

770
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,730
This is the biggest matter right now.

771
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,150
You have been close to her
since childhood.

772
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,140
Before her wedding,

773
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,640
you cannot let the Jinxiu people

774
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,440
see our royal family as divided.

775
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,400
Your Majesty,
since you said you will not pursue it,

776
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,680
then we will not.

777
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,440
But in the future,

778
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,110
if I act against anyone
around the Empress,

779
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,160
I ask that you treat it the same way.

780
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,050
How dare you!

781
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,180
She is your mother after all!

782
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,540
She has never been my mother.

783
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,070
For the sake
of a mere Jinxiu prisoner of war,

784
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,110
you're deliberately

785
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,300
opposing me today.

786
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,750
No matter how lawless you are,

787
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,890
there are limits.

788
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,980
After all, Susha

789
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,860
is still ruled by me.

790
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,860
Of course you're the ruler.

791
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,230
Wasn't it also you back then

792
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,630
who tacitly allowed them

793
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,720
to murder my mother?

794
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,760
Your Majesty!

795
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,360
Your Majesty!

796
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,400
Please don't be angry.

797
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,440
-Your health is more important.
-Your Highness.

798
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,150
Your Highness, kneel, please.

799
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,860
I'm begging you,

800
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,330
please kneel now!

801
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,590
I issued a strict order long ago

802
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,630
forbidding anyone

803
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,270
from mentioning the late Empress.

804
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,070
How dare you defy my decree?

805
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,540
Why forbid it?

806
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,940
Could it be that you feel guilty?

807
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,690
What did you say?

808
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,350
Do you really want me to repeat it?

809
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,640
Convey my imperial order:

810
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,880
The First Prince has committed
great insubordination

811
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,140
and defied his elders.

812
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,150
He is to return to his residence
and reflect on his conduct.

813
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,320
Before Xiyang's wedding,
the ancestral offering ceremony

814
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,770
will be performed instead
by the Second Prince, Chengyang.

815
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,930
Your Highness!

816
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,360
I shall take my leave as well.

817
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:02,000
Let's go.
