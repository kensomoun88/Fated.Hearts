You're wounded.

386
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,160
Just a flesh wound. No big deal.

387
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,510
How's the situation on your side?

388
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,050
Some of the assassins were killed,
some fled,

389
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,280
but we caught one alive.

among civilians and soldiers?

00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,090
Five civilians died.

395
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,290
Over 20 were injured.

396
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,390
We lost eight of our men.

A dozen or so were wounded.

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,630
To kill me,

401
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,750
you didn't hesitate
to harm innocent people.

402
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,680
So many people died because of you!

403
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,360
I only regret my bad luck.

404
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,870
I sacrificed all those lives

405

and still couldn't kill you.

406
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,600
You really deserve worse than death.

407
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,160
How are the injured?

408
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,570
Is anyone in critical condition?

Several are severely wounded.

412

413
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,480
I'll ask him to help treat them.

414

That's not up to you.

I had you brought here

447

449

Whether His Highness cares about me

451
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,430
is none of your business!

00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,350
the better I feel.

463
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,820
You're insane.

576
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,160
Mother!

577
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,910
What happened?

578
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,250
Why are you here?

579
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,920
Eunuch Ma,

580
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,420
didn't I tell you

581
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,010
not to disturb Chengyang?

582
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,050
This...

583
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,740
Mother,

584
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,680
please get up.

585
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,190
The floor is hard and cold.

586
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,230
Your knees will be damaged.

587
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,020
Be good.

588
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,280
Go back now.

589
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,060
Mother.

590
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,470
Did you argue with Father again?

591
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,190
Let me plead for you.

592
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,240
Don't get involved in this.

593
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Stay out of it.

594
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,090
Go back right now.

595
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,930
No matter what happened,

596
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,620
even if you've made countless mistakes,

597
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,150
I'll take the blame for you.

598
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,030
I'll kneel here for you.

599
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,430
Mother, go back and rest.

600
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,400
Chengyang,

601
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,760
be good.

602
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,710
I've never disobeyed you before.

603
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,570
Just let me disobey you this once.

604
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,530
[Grace in Blessed Accord]

605
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,630
Eunuch Ma,

606
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,590
the First Prince

607
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,070
has arrested Zhuang…

608
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,750
[Changchun Palace]

609
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,680
Your Majesty,

610
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,710
the First Prince has entered the palace.

611
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,280
He's arrested Prime Minister Zhuang

612
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
and is heading to Changchun Palace.

613
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,030
He arrested Zhuang Shen?

614
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,590
Yes.

615
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,880
The elite troops of the Feng Battalion
assembled last night.

616
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,290
Has he

617
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,960
led the Feng Battalion into the city?

618
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,790
No.

619
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,190
This morning, His Highness

620
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,070
went to the Zhuang Residence

621
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,230
with only a few dozen men.

622
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,000
He was ambushed on Yongning Street.

623
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,710
The head of the assassins was

624
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,670
Zhuang Ming, the Prime Minister's nephew.

625
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,000
Zhuang Ming is now dead.

626
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,620
His Highness came alone

627
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,230
with Prime Minister Zhuang.

628
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:37,800
Suige…

629
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,720
Is the First Prince injured?

630
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,980
He seems mostly fine,

631
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,300
but Prime Minister Zhuang is injured.

632
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,620
He doesn't look good.

633
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,470
Your Majesty,

634
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,400
Her Majesty and the Second Prince

635
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,660
are kneeling outside.

636
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,260
Do you want them to leave?

637
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,700
Make Chengyang leave.

638
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,480
What about Her Majesty?

639
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,630
This is her fate.

640
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,840
She cannot avoid it.

641
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,000
Yes.

642
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,150
This day

643
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,960
has finally come.

644
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,400
[Grace in Blessed Accord]

645
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,570
Second Prince.

646
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:28,760
Let me go!

647
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,130
Forgive me, Your Highness.

648
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,770
Please leave.

649
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,480
This is His Majesty's order.

650
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,400
With my mother here like this,

651
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,710
how could I possibly leave?

652
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,780
If Father is angry,

653
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,530
I'm willing to be punished.

654
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,480
Escort His Highness back.

655
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,140
-Yes.
-Yes.

656
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,620
-Chengyang.
-Mother!

657
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,110
Father!

658
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,840
Eunuch Ma,

659
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,760
what is the meaning of this?

660
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,760
Your Majesty,

661
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,920
His Majesty ordered this

662
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,580
to protect the Second Prince.

663
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,000
Tell me,

664
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,170
has something happened?

665
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,840
You'll know soon enough.

666
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,200
My Lords,

667
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,110
when the First Prince
entered the palace earlier,

668
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,670
he instructed me
to wait here with a message.

669
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,580
You shall all

670
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,800
go to the Changchun Palace.

671
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Please follow me.

672
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,440
Hurry!

673
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,270
[Changchun Palace]

674
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:01,450
Stop her!

675
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,480

676
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,470

677
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,510
Let go of me!

680
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,560
what happened?

681
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,760
Father!

682
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,190
Let me go!

683
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:12,840
Let…

684
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,150
Father!

685
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,400
Father!

686
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,440
I want to see my mother!

687
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,280
Mother!

688
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,800
Let go of me!

689
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,030
I want to see my mother!

690
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,880
Let go of me!

691
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,590
I want to see my mother!

692
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,780
Let go of me!

693
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,070
Let go of me!

694
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,330
I want to see my mother!

695
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,030

Let go of me!

I want to see my mother!

698
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,380
Let go of me!

699
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,920
Mother!

700
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
I want to see my mother!

701
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,650
Let go of me!

702
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,920
I want to see my mother!

703
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,630
Mother!

704
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,590

Let go…

Father.

712
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,400
Father,

713
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,860
what exactly happened?

714
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,590
Father!

715
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,360
Let me go!

716
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,770

[Grace in Blessed Accord]

718
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,490
Feng Suige,

719
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,880
what are you going to do?

720
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,190
This is the imperial palace.

721
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,070
How dare you attack the Prime Minister?

722
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,670
Are you staging a rebellion?

723
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,820
It was at this place that you

724
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,410
killed my mother back then.

725
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,660
Today, I'll make you pay for it

726
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,630
with your life here.

727
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:42,530
Let go!

728
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,640
Your Majesty.

729
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,830
Your Majesty.

730
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,910
Your Majesty,

731
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,190
I beg for your mercy.

732
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,440
Please save my father.

733
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,840
No matter how grave his crimes,

734
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,150
he is still my father

735
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,360
and Chengyang's grandfather.

736
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,360
I would rather die myself

737
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,150
than watch my father die.

738
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,470
Your Majesty,

739
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,840
for the sake of the years

740
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,960
we spent as husband and wife,

741
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,630
please save him.

742
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,990
Your Majesty,

743
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,710
only you can

744
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,960
stop Feng Suige now.

745
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,970
Your Majesty, have you agreed?

746
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,670
Empress.

747
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,190
My condolences.

748
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,150
What did you say?

749
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,630
Don't you remember?

750
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,590
15 years ago, right here,

751
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,510
I watched helplessly

752
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,900
as Qingyu died.

753
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,840
The first thing

754
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,570
you said to me was

755
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,380
"My condolences."

756
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,640
Your Majesty,

757
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:30,600
my condolences.

758
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,480
You're the Empress of Susha.

759
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,760
How can you cry?

760
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,190
Your father schemed meticulously

761
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,320
to kill Qingyu

762
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,070
just so you could become empress.

763
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,800
He's about to die now.

764
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,000
This is the last time

765
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,670
he'll ever see his daughter.

766
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,150
He should see

767
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,440
the dignified,

768
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,030
composed,
