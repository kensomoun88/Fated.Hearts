00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,000
[1 tael of stalactite,
1 tael of red gypsum]

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,810
[Half tael of amethyst, half tael of
cinnamon twig with coarse bark removed]

191
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,770
Physician Xu found this prescription

192
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,340
in ancient medical texts.

193
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,290
He's absolutely confident

194
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,020
that it can awaken His Majesty.

195
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,890
Are you truly confident?

196
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,480
This is a serious matter.

197
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,720
You must not speak carelessly.

198
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,030
The pills produced from

199
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,040
this prescription I found

200
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,240
are actually highly toxic.

201
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,480
The medicine actually uses its power

202
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,080
to forcibly stimulate life energy.

203
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,480
Once His Majesty takes it,
he'll surely awaken.

204
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,350
However...

205
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,480
However, it will be like
a fleeting revival.

206
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,740
His life will soon end.

207
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,950
You mean

208
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,860
taking this medicine

209
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,230
means certain death?

210
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,150
Yes.

211
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,480
After waking from this medicine,

212
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,540
he'll live no more than 5 days at most.

213
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,120
By tomorrow morning at the earliest,

214
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,270
I can have

215
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,450
this pill prepared.

216
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,190
Physician Xu.

217
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,200
This matter must never be disclosed.

218
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,400
I don't need to remind you further, do I?

219
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,590
I wouldn't dare.

220
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,870
The lives of my entire family

221
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,510
are in Prime Minister Zhuang's hands.

222
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,960
I would never dare to betray him.

223
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,020
I'll definitely do
as Prime Minister Zhuang commands.

224
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,510
After it's done,

225
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,150
this person cannot be left alive.

226
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,200
Only the dead can keep secrets.

227
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
I understand, Uncle.

228
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,390
Miss Yixiao, come here.

229
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,040
What's wrong with His Highness?

230
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,100
I was talking to him just now,

231
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,480
but he ignored me. It feels like

232
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,410
he's radiating murderous intent.

233
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,170
Look, you're not talking either.

234
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,580
What's going on with you both?

235
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,770
He's obviously upset.

236
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,670
When he wants to talk,

237
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,200
he will.

238
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,650
Some things

239
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,270
are better left for him
to tell you himself

240
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,500
when the time comes.

241
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,170
Is it that serious?

242
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,550
Alright then.

243
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,030
I-I won't pursue further then.

244
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,080
At times like this,

245
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,680
I'd better keep my distance.

246
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,370
You'd better not

247
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,550
bring that bad luck upon yourself either.

248
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,310
Be careful.

249
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,290
I'm leaving now.

250
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,200
What are you thinking about?

251
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,310
I'll leave the wine here for you.

252
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,280
I won't disturb you any further.

253
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,910
Why is your name Fu Yixiao?

254
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,230
Didn't you say

255
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,610
you never met your parents?

256
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,480
Then who gave you your name?

257
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,770
Why do you have the surname Fu?

258
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,170
So all that brooding of yours—

259
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,870
turns out this is
what you've been thinking about?

260
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,120
Fu Yixiao.

261
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,910
Commander Fu.

262
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,980
That name of yours sounds like

263
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,530
you're someone's deputy.

264
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,390
Why don't you join

265
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,580
my Feng Battalion?

266
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,400
I'll make you a chief commander.

267
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,750
You can be whatever you want

268
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,750
and take whatever surname you want.

269
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,360
It's already come to this,

270
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,150
why do you still have

271
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,680
so many trivial questions?

272
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,480
Then why do you bother

273
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,300
answering these trivial questions?

274
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,170
Because you're the one asking.

275
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,820
It's only when I'm with you

276
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,720
that I can speak without restraint

277
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,380
and ask whatever I want.

278
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,630
I chose my own name.

279
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,720
It means that
no matter how sad things get,

280
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,110
I can just smile

281
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,270
and forget it all.

282
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,890
Isn't that wonderful?

283
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,120
It is.

284
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,040
You really have forgotten it all.

285
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,670
And here I was,

286
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,200
worrying that you were upset

287
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,130
and thinking of how to comfort you,

288
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
yet you're making fun of me instead.

289
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,570
I wish I could forget it all too,

290
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,550
but I can't.

291
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,240
Awake, I'm troubled.

292
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,360
Asleep, I'm still troubled.

293
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,010
You were betrayed by your friends,

294
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,150
yet I've been there by your side,

295
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,720
trying to say something profound

296
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,670
to comfort you.

297
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,550
Now that I think about it,

298
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,350
I must have been quite annoying.

299
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,700
Not at all.

300
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,390
Actually, I wish

301
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,660
I could comfort you

302
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,480

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,170
would find out sooner or later.

373
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,020
You command the Imperial Guards.

374
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,670
What's there to be afraid of?

375
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,840
But my father is in their hands!

376
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,830
I don't care what plans

377
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,360
you have,

378
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,700
stop them immediately!

379
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,640
If anything happens to Feng Pingcheng,

380
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,350
my father's life will be in danger.

381
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,750
The arrow has left the bow.

382
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,030
How can I stop now?

383
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,710
Besides, your father

384
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,890
neither took part in our plan

385
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,490
nor knew anything about it,

386
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,470
and he even saved Feng Suige's life.

387
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,200
I don't think

388
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,610
Feng Suige would take it out on him.

389
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,650
Are you asking me to gamble
with my father's life?

390
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,190
To achieve great things,

391
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,690
one must take decisive action.

392
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,480
You lost your son and want revenge,

393
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,880
but does that mean

394
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,680
my father's life doesn't count?

395
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,930
What do you want then?

396
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,410
You want us to just stop now

397
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,120
and wait for execution?

398
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,200
I don't care!

399
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,620
Once I get my father back,

400
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,000
you can do whatever you want,

401
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,310
and I absolutely won't stand in your way!

402
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,070
Do you think this is

403
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,550
just kids playing house?

404
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,630
This is not a negotiation.

405
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,940
Your heart

406
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
seems to have something to say to me.

407
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,650
What does it say?

408
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,310
Shh.

409
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,800
Let me listen carefully.

410
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,270
It says

411
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,640
it aches,

412
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,580
betrayed by your closest friend.

413
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,240
But it's okay.

414
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,260
It's trying hard

415
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,790
to heal little by little.

416
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,550
Right.

417
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,110
Because I have you by my side.

418
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,380
It also says

419
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,960
it doesn't want to be hurt again.

420
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,070
If anything happens in the future,

421
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,330
just tell me directly.

422
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,340
Don't keep it to yourself.

423
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,790
It doesn't want to be a messenger anymore.

424
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,270
Okay.

425
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,150
I promise you.

426
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,930
But something's not right.

427
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,460
It says

428
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,580
it feels somewhat uneasy,

429
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,830
because you're not telling me the truth.

430
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,560
Nothing gets past you, does it?

431
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,030
I'm worried about His Majesty.

432
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,400
The Imperial Guards are under

433
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,660
Murong Yao's command.

434
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,230
Now that I discovered his true nature,

435
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,750
I'm concerned that the Jinwu Guards

436
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,550
won't be able to
protect His Majesty properly.

437
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,290
So you want to lead your men

438
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,550
into the palace to protect His Majesty?

439
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,850
But if you do that,

440
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,160
you could be framed

441
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,640
for attempting to rebel.

442
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,220
My conscience is clear.

443
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,880
Why should I fear such petty accusations?

444
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,210
Alright.

445
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,280
Since you've made up your mind,

446
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,510
don't worry,

447
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,440
I'll be with you.

448
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,410
Your Highness!

449
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,780
Your Highness.

450
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,310
What's the matter?

451
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,910
Wu Ying...

452
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,300
She bled to death.

453
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,440
She died?

454
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,680
It's a pity that you didn't get to

455
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,410
avenge her with your own hands.

456
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,840
Do you want to go see?

457
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,590
No need.

458
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,720
I don't want to soil my eyes.

459
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,830
Burn her.

460
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,680
Sure.

461
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,920
Sure.

462
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,970
[Zhuang Residence]

463
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,360
Please.

464
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,000
Here.

465
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,070
-Congratulations, Minister.
-Congratulations, Minister.

466
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,110
Thank you.

467
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,300
Thank you.

468
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,150
Father.

469
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,730
I wish you longevity
like the pine and crane,

470
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,990
and fortune greater than the North Star.

471
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,880
Fortune greater than the North Star?

472
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,430
Have you lost your mind?

473
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,060
The North Star represents
the Emperor's position.

474
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,400
Fortunately, there're no outsiders here.

475
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,060
Otherwise,

476
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,040
you'd be guilty of treason.

477
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,030
Father.

478
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,310
Let's not talk about this now.

479
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,110
Didn't I tell you

480
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,630
I prepared a surprise for you?

481
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,500
Let me show you.

482
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:41,830
Father.

483
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,880
This is the birthday gift

484
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,740
I've carefully prepared for you.

485
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,270
I remember you said

486
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,530
that after turning 55,

487
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,640
you would petition His Majesty

488
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,400
to retire and return to our hometown.

489
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,030
So this past year,
I've been searching diligently

490
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,830
and finally found in Puzhou

491
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,320
the largest fortress.

492
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,270
This fortress has walls 50 feet high

493
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,510
and watchtowers 200 feet tall.

494
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,680
Inside, there're 10 halls, 9 pavilions,

495
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,480
and 300 rooms.

496
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,770
It can accommodate 1,000 horses.

497
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,590
Inside, there's also

498
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,680
a massive granary

499
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,810
that can store enough food
for 1,000 people for 3 years.

500
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,710
Why would I need such a thing?

501
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,180
Father, hold on.

502
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,440
I haven't finished yet.

503
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,830
I've also purchased
the 10,000 acres of farmland

504
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,760
surrounding it,

505
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,550
enough to station 3,000 troops.

506
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,240
You want to maintain a private army?

507
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,790
Are you planning a rebellion?

508
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,960
Why would I rebel?

509
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,070
I just want to give our family

510
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,470
a chance to live freely,

511
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,240
without having to please others.

512
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,700
Father,

513
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,590
you've worked hard your whole life.

514
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,690
It's time to enjoy some peace and comfort.

515
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,910
Don't tell me

516
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,200
you've already started

517
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,860
preparing armor and weapons?

518
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,110
You know me so well, Father.

519
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,070
The designs are ready,

520
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,930
but making them

521
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,660
takes time.

522
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,370
You cannot do this!

523
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,730
But, Father,

524
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,920
you've worked hard your whole life,

525
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,110
toiling for others.

526
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,550
I just wanted to give you

527
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,310
a chance to spend your later years
in peace.

528
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,590
With this fortress in Puzhou,

529
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,760
you can rest easy.

530
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,550
With our doors shut,

531
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,590
even if the King of Heaven himself came,

532
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,550
we wouldn't need to be afraid.

533
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,640
You rose to power together with
His Majesty,

534
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,240
so why

535
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,400
should you worship him

536
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,640
and work day and night for him?

537
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,240
You've really lost your mind!

538
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,830
If anyone finds out,

539
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,160
this is open rebellion!

540
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,680
If I had known you had such

541
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,940
treasonous thoughts,

542
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,680
I should never have

543
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,110
let you go out to gain experience!

544
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,510
Go to Puzhou immediately

545
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,810
and get rid of all these fortresses

546
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,150
and farmhouses at once!

Zhuang Jingheng.

548
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,940
Someone has reported
that you're harboring private troops

549
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,140
with intent to rebel.

550
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,400
Come with us.

551
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,840
Father...

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,400
Uncle.

00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,110
Physician Xu has prepared the pill.

554
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,240
Prepare the carriage.

555
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,700
I'm going into the palace.

[List of Dowry]

557
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,030
That old emperor of Susha

558
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,290
is quite interesting.

559
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,420
His daughter eloped,

560
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,220
yet he arranged for her dowry
to be delivered.

561
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,120
Besides the dowry,

562
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,640
they've also sent

563
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,160
a maid of Princess of Susha.

564
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,100
By rights,

565
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,590
both the maid and the dowry

566
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,200
should be sent to Her Highness.

567
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,640
It's just the Prince of Zhennan
and his wife

568
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,400
are both residing in the palace now,

569
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,980
so I must ask for
Your Majesty's instructions.

570
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,890
Alright.

571
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,320
Just send them to my place

572
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,090
and hand them over to Bai Shouzhuo.

573
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,070
Find accommodation for that maid.

574
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,030
This matter

575
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,160
must absolutely not

576
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,490
be known to anyone else.

577
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,130
Your Highness.

578
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,070
The guards at the gate
have indeed been withdrawn.

579
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,810
Good.

580
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,350
I'll take this opportunity
to go out for a walk.

581
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:04,990
By the way,

582
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,770
take Princess Xiyang

583
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,770
out for a walk too.

584
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,960
She needs some fresh air
after all these days.

585
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,350
Yes.

586
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,270
You may leave now.

587
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,530
Yes.

588
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,070
The water's cold.

589
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,370
It's still cold.

590
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,720
Feng.

591
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,200
Never thought

592
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,370
you'd see this day, did you?

593
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,270
Lying before me,

594
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,030
completely helpless,

595
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,750
with your life in my hands.

596
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,940
Do you regret

597
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,300
what you said that day

598
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,160
when I knelt before you,

599
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,590
begging you

600
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,110
to spare my son's life?

601
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,970
Prime Minister Zhuang.

602
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,370
You've always been impartial

603
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,800
and strictly fair.

604
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,270
You've never once asked me

605
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,750
for mercy out of personal feelings,

606
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,550
nor bent the law for private gain.

607
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,610
I beg Your Majesty.

608
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,920
He's my only son.

609
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,070
I boldly beg Your Majesty
to spare his life.

610
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,020
Look for yourself.

611
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,960
All these

612
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,440
are memorials denouncing him.

613
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,720
Hiding weapons and private troops

614
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,960
with intent to rebel—

615
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,510
that's the grave crime of treason,

616
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,880
punishable by the extermination
of his entire nine-lineage family.

617
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,400
I've already spared your entire family

618
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,440
out of consideration

619
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,550
for your loyal service.

620
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,900
Zhuang Shen.

621
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,000
You're the Prime Minister of Susha.

622
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,840
If I were to grant your request,

623
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,680
how would I command the respect of all

624
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,880
and face the entire court of officials?

625
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,380
If you were in my position,

626
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,070
what would you do?

627
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,050
I also watched Jingheng

628
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,220
grow up.

629
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,510
Though he committed a grave crime

630
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,350
and cannot be honored
in the ancestral temple,

631
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,550
I'll allow you

632
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,320
to give him a proper burial.

633
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,500
You traded your son

634
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,490
for the peace of my kingdom—

635
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,830
I'll remember

636
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,840
this debt of gratitude.

637
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,400
You said

638
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,750
I traded my son

639
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,900
for the peace of your kingdom,

640
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,130
and you claimed to remember
that debt of gratitude.

641
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,390
I've always

642
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,550
kept that debt in my heart.

643
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,960
13 years.

644
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,510
It's been 13 years!

645
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,000
Not for one day

646
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,330
or even one hour
have I forgotten about it!

647
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,110
Jingheng didn't have to die.

648
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,000
What crime had he committed?

649
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,870
All he did was spend money

650
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,830
to buy a house.

651
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,830
He only slightly overstepped his bounds,

652
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,830
but he didn't actually do anything!

653
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,510
It was all because of you.

654
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,900
It was me you resented!

655
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,670
You blamed me

656
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,790
for the late Empress's death.

657
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,000
But why make Jingheng

658
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,660
suffer for it all?

659
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,790
8 days.

660
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,830
During the 8 days
you've been lying here,

661
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,070
I could've killed you at any moment

662
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,300
to avenge Jingheng!

663
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,240
Even if the Jinwu Guards
killed me afterward,

664
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,590
it would only be a life for a life!

665
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,030
What's the worth

666
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,530
of this old life of mine anyway?

667
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,670
But I won't let you

668
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,920
die so easily.

669
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,110
I want you to watch

670
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,880
your son die with your own eyes.

671
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,190
I want you to feel

672
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,340
the agony of losing a child yourself!

673
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,239
I've prepared the pill for you.

674
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,230
As soon as I catch Feng Suige,

675
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,310
I'll make you take this pill.

676
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,840
This is a miraculous pill.

677
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,770
Once you take it,

678
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,230
you'll immediately regain consciousness,

679
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,150
so you can see your son die
right before your eyes

680
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,440
in a sober state!

681
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,110
Unfortunately, though.

682
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,850
Unfortunately, this pill is poisonous.

683
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,030
After you take it,

684
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,800
you'll die within 5 days.

685
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,710
How I wish you wouldn't die.

686
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,310
I wish you could suffer as I have,

687
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,370
enduring the pain of losing your child
for 13 years!

688
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,000
Only that would be fair!

689
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,190
Today is

690
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,850
the last time I came to see you.

691
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,070
These words have been hidden in my heart

692
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,030
for too long,

693
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,150
and I had to say them out loud.

694
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,290
It's just a shame

695
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,590
that you can't hear me.

696
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,440
You old bastard,

697
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,150
still luckier than I am.

698
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,670
Yesterday, when they

699
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,190
returned to Zhengnian Villa,

700
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:18,880
Fang asked

701
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,210
when Master would come.

702
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,320
I wonder

703
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,850
if they've settled in well.

704
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,210
Don't worry, My Lady.

705
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,670
They're all very sensible.

706
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,760
They understand that Miss Yixiao

707
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,510
has important matters to attend to.

708
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,110
I asked Mr. Qin

709
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,440
to hire a tutor for them,

710
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,230
and they've agreed

711
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,890
to settle down here properly.

712
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,570
That's good.

713
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,150
This is Physician Hou's prescription.

714
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,150
Instruct someone

715
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,000
to give him medicine on time every day.

716
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,070
He's out of danger now.

717
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,530
He'll wake up in a few days.

718
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,070
Got it.

719
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,410
By the way,

720
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,470
go help me pack a few things.

721
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,080
I'm going on a long journey.

722
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,030
My Lady, you...

723
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,510
You're not going to that

724
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,960
so-called mysterious place, are you?

725
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,810
Yes, I am.

726
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,340
I promised Sister.

727
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,500
Still no news of Ning Fei?

728
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,720
Don't worry.

729
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,230
I pestered my father for information.

730
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,280
The place where Ning Fei was sent

731
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,480
is called the Storm Alliance.

732
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,190
My father said

733
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,710
those of the Storm Alliance
are very skilled.

734
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,310
They'll definitely be able to
revive Ning Fei.

735
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,550
Rest assured.

736
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,730
Once I return to Zhengnian Villa

737
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,360
and get Fang and the others settled,

738
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,960
I'll go visit the Storm Alliance in person

739
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,560
and check on Ning Fei for you.

740
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,920
So do you know

741
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,520
where the Storm Alliance is?

742
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,670
Of course.

743
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,110
My father knows all too well

744
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:24,880
how I can never stop digging

745
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,110
once I start asking questions.

746
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,350
I kept pestering him,

747
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,750
so he finally told me.

748
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,450
But wait.

749
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,070
Master sent a letter

750
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,280
instructing Mr. Qin

751
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
to watch over you, My Lady,

752
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,860
and not let you wander off.

753
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,940
Eleven.

754
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,580
You just be good and stay here, all right?

755
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,710
I...

756
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,870
[Linfang Hall]

757
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,350
A life of deep affection

758
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,550
and perfect harmony as husband and wife—

759
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,880
that I cannot grant you.

760
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,550
Princess, there's nothing I can do

761
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,810
about your obsession.

762
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,170
Greetings, Your Majesty.

763
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,190
Princess, did you personally
pick these flowers

764
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,650
for the Prince of Zhennan?

765
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,920
Such touching devotion.

766
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,600
Unfortunately, my brother

767
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,810
is too stubborn.

768
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,460
Once he's made up his mind,

769
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,210
it's nearly impossible to change it.

770
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,220
No one else knows this,

771
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:09,710
but I

772
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,560
am the one who knows him best.

773
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,380
What do you mean by that, Your Majesty?

774
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,320
After all, I've been

775
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,980
his brother for so many years.

776
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,960
Back then, I beat him, scolded him,

777
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,550
imprisoned him in the imperial jail,

778
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,950
yet he still refused to
admit his mistakes.

779
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
That's just the kind of person he is.

780
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,750
I'm feeling unwell

781
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,320
and must take my leave.

782
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,920
Are you leaving the flowers?

783
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,590
Giving such beautiful flowers

784
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,110
to my

785
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,030
romantically clueless brother

786
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,190
would be such a waste.

787
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,390
Fresh blooms are meant to
be paired with beautiful women.

788
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,310
If His Highness enjoys them,

789
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,760
then they won't be wasted.

790
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,000
Too bad he doesn't know
how to cherish beauty.

791
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,730
If I were him,

792
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,670
I wouldn't let a beauty

793
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,440
stand here brooding all alone.

794
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,750
Please show some self-respect,
Your Majesty!

795
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,630
This is the first time

796
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,560
anyone dares to treat me like that.

797
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,320
Interesting.

798
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,750
His Highness is waiting for you inside.

799
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,000
His Highness's instruction:

800
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,280
everyone, eat first!

801
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,030
Yes!

802
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,000
What has His Highness summoned

803
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,150
the Qiongqi Unit here for?

804
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,670
These are a bunch of lunatics.

805
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,590
Every single one of them

806
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,520
has dozens of lives on their hands.

807
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,000
Yun Qing.

808
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,640
Give them a heads-up

809
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,590
that when they meet Miss Yixiao,

810
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,990
they must not act rashly.

811
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,530
Your Highness.

812
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,510
You want the Qiongqi Unit
to enter the palace

813
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,320
to protect His Majesty?

814
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,120
That's right.

815
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,360
They'll enter as my household guards,

816
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,490
with no waist tokens

817
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,800
and no armor.

818
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,320
This is the only plan

819
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,650
we can think of right now

820
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,510
that won't give anyone leverage

821
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,550
against us.

822
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,360
If soldiers of the Feng Battalion
were to appear

823
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,550
to protect His Majesty,

824
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,400
people would suspect

825
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,920
the First Prince of plotting rebellion.

826
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,610
Then

827
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,070
Prime Minister Zhuang
would mobilize troops

828
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,630
to surround the Feng Battalion.

829
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,320
So our only option is

830
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,400
to achieve great effect with little force—

831
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,230
enter the palace as household guards

832
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,440
to protect His Majesty

833
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,480
until he wakes up.

834
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:57,930
Your Highness.

835
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,760
This is Fu Yixiao,

836
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,320
Jinxiu's finest archer.

837
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,840
She's one of our own now.

838
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,280
Your Highness, you summoned us.

839
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,320
Who do you want us to deal with?

840
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,550
Come with me to enter the palace
to protect His Majesty.

841
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,030
If anyone threatens His Majesty,

842
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,190
no matter who they are,

843
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,920
kill them without hesitation.

844
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,360
As you command, Your Highness.

845
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,360
Whoever Your Highness wants dealt with,

846
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,690
we'll take care of them.

847
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,670
You just need to take your men

848
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,230
and guard outside His Majesty's chambers.

849
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,920
I'll assist you.

850
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,030
When we work,

851
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,670
we don't need anyone's help.

852
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,930
After I finish the job,

853
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,020
I'll challenge you to a match.

854
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,840
Anytime.

855
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,750
Very well.

856
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,230
Keep your mouth shut
if you don't want trouble.

857
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,960
From now on, what Fu Yixiao says

858
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,510
represents my will.

859
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,280
To work alongside the famous Fu Yixiao

860
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,670
and fight enemies together

861
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,960
is my greatest honor.

862
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,610
Don't worry.

863
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,360
You won't need to lift a finger.

864
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,710
Those Imperial Guards

865
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,590
live on meager rations.

866
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,250
They're all weaklings.

867
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,440
All the better.

868
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,840
After finishing your meal, get changed

869
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,920
and get ready to go.

870
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,230
Yes!
