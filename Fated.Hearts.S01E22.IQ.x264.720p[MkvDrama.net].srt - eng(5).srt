00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,020
[Episode 22]

3
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

4
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,230
The two princes have been

5
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,560
accompanying His Majesty this whole time.

6
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,280
I advised them to go back and rest.

7
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,009
Tonight,

8
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,370
I will stay here
to watch over His Majesty.

9
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,780
Leave us.

10
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,980
I already know about
His Majesty's illness.

11
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,490
Please take care of yourself,
Your Majesty.

12
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,980
Let me have a moment alone with him.

13
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,050
Your Majesty...

14
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:27,670
Get out!

15
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,130
Fifteen years.

16
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,030
You've been terminally ill for 15 years,

17
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,840
and you never

18
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,240
said a word to me about it.

19
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,510
Your Majesty,

20
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,880
you've really been keeping me in the dark.

21
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,370
Never mind.

22
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,580
You must have your reasons

23
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,310
for not telling me.

24
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,400
You're always the one

25
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
who makes the most sense.

26
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,620
We've been married for so many years.

27
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,710
When have you ever considered me

28
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,110
in any of your decisions?

29
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,550
Your Majesty,

30
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,280
guess

31
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,590
what I've brought you.

32
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,560
Zongzi.

33
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,640
You didn't expect that, did you?

34
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,230
Those people must think

35
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,970
I've lost my mind.

36
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,840
The Dragon Boat Festival was a month ago,

37
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,370
but today I suddenly feel like
having zongzi.

38
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,300
Your Majesty, you know

39
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,710
I've always loved zongzi.

40
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,150
But...

41
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,100
I haven't had one

42
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,300
in 15 years.

43
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,070
Your Majesty,

44
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,660
zongzi is so delicious.

45
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,870
Smell it.

46
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,060
Doesn't it smell good?

47
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,320
Do you know

48
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,870
why I haven't eaten zongzi

49
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,920
in 15 years?

50
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,750
Of course you do.

51
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,200
On the 5th day of the 5th month
15 years ago,

52
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,930
that woman died right in front of you.

53
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,630
Since then,

54
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,800
you've never celebrated
the Dragon Boat Festival again,

55
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,530
and you've never eaten zongzi.

56
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,670
Your Majesty.

57
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,330
You actually have the leisure today

58
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,960
to tend to plants?

59
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,190
These plants

60
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,190
must have accumulated great fortune

61
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,590
over several lifetimes to receive your...

62
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,030
What brings you here today?

63
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,160
I came to celebrate the festival with you.

64
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,980
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.

65
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,040
Your Majesty,
you haven't had any zongzi yet, have you?

66
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,430
I made these myself today.

67
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,630
They're just freshly steamed.

68
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,560
Please try some, Your Majesty.

69
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,970
I have no appetite.

70
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,110
Just one bite, Your Majesty.

71
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,190
Your Majesty.

72
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,190
How dare you!

73
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,070
Your Majesty.

74
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,800
Get up.

75
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,950
I don't want them.

76
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,870
Take them away

77
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,960
and share them with the kids.

78
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,360
You said you hated her

79
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,630
and forbade anyone
from ever mentioning her.

80
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,830
You erased

81
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,890
every trace of her,

82
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,800
as if

83
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,390
she had never existed.

84
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,700
But she's here.

85
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,380
She's been here all along.

86
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,630
I've spent 15 years

87
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,560
and still haven't been able
to reach your heart.

88
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,310
Is it because

89
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,510
you don't care about me

90
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,570
that you've hidden

91
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,650
your terminal illness from me?

92
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,480
Fine.

93
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,190
From today on,

94
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,159
I don't care whether you like me or not.

95
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,280
I only want what I like.

96
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,750
I've already given you

97
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,150
the first half of my life.

98
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,270
Now I want you to spend the rest of it
with me!

99
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,270
Feng Pingcheng!

100
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,340
Wake up!

106
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,270
Pull the Empress away!

107
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,680
Open your eyes and look at me!

108
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,080
Hurry!

109
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,050
Feng Pingcheng!

110
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,720
Let go of me!

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,390
Feng Pingcheng!

112
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,280
Wake up!

113
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,240
Feng Pingcheng, wake up right now!

Your Majesty...

117
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,950
What should I do?

118
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,830
What should I do now?

119
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,850
Your Majesty...

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,120
Feng Pingcheng!

121
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,390
Let go of me!

122
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,360
Let go of me!

123
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,630
I can walk by myself!

[Yifeng Palace]

125
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,750
Get lost! All of you!

126
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,550
-Yes.
-Yes.

127
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,790
All of you, get out!

128
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,750
Mother.

129
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,910
Mother.

130
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,480
Don't be too sad.

131
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,150
I'm here with you.

132
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,880
Brother said

133
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,880
that Father will surely wake up.

134
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,120
Mother,

135
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,260
please take care of yourself.

136
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,960
Don't cry until your eyes are swollen.

137
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,600
If Father wakes up and sees that,

138
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,650
he'll be upset.

139
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,130
He wouldn't be upset at all.

140
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,000
In his heart and eyes,

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,330
there's no place for me,

142
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,960
or for you.

143
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,410
The only one he cares about is that woman.

144
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,630
That woman?

145
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,780
You mean Brother's birth mother?

146
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,480
You see him as your brother,

147
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,930
but has he ever acknowledged you
as his brother?

148
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,150
Remember,

149
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,670
Feng Suige

150
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,440
is your greatest enemy in this lifetime.

151
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,240
You'd better stay away from him.

152
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,800
Do you know

153
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,360
what will happen

154
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,090
if your father doesn't wake up?

155
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,010
Feng Suige will ascend the throne.

156
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,080
By then, he'll kill you

157
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,370
and me.

158
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,890
If he succeeds,

159
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,000
we'll both die.

160
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,790
He's always hated me

161
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,720
for causing his birth mother's death.

162
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,510
That's why he refuses

163
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,840
to acknowledge me as his mother,

164
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,320
or you as his brother.

165
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,810
He's been waiting for this day.

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,130
He's waiting for your father to be gone

167
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,660
so he can take his revenge.

168
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,750
And your father, even though

169
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,680
he knows exactly what will happen,

170
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,180
still refuses to name a crown prince.

171
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,480
I know he hates me deep down.

172
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,840
Mother,

173
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,150
please stop.

174
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,270
Don't speak of them that way.

175
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,010
Even you're taking their side now?

176
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,130
Once your father passes away

177
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,000
and Feng Suige takes the throne,

178
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,130
he'll kill you

179
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,030
and all of us.

180
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,870
Our lives are in your hands.

181
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,200
Only you can protect us.

182
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,290
I want you to take the throne

183
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,760
and kill Feng Suige.

184
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,840
That's the only way we'll survive.

[Imperial Hospital]

186
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,440
From today on,

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,840
no one is allowed to leave

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,130
until we find a way to save His Majesty.

189
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,280
Eating, drinking, and dumping—

190
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,040
you'll do everything here.

191

Even Lord Ling from Zhengnian Villa

192

has no solution.

193
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,240
We're at a complete loss as well.

194
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,490
Physician Wei,

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,360
that must be very difficult for you.

196
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,320
No, not at all.

197
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,350
Being at a loss

198
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,850
just shows your medical skills
are lacking.

199
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,700
It's better to die

200
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,270
and, in your next life,

201
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,670
study medicine properly from the start.

202
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,510
Don't you all

203
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:24,960
agree?

204
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,490
What do you say?

205
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,790
I'll take your silence

206
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,590
as agreement.

207
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,820
From now on,

208
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,550
if you find any method in medical books

209
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,630
that could wake His Majesty,

210
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,990
try it on him.

211
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,480
Don't worry about whether he might die.

212
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,440
If he does, I'll get you

213
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,090
another one.

214
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,610
[Murong Residence]

215
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,750
Elder Marquis eats well

216
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,030
and sleeps soundly.

217
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,810
Don't worry.

218
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,300
No need to thank me.

219
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,390
Yixiao.

220
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,320
My Lord,

221
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,480
we chased down 3 streets

222
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,080
but couldn't find the archer.

223
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,270
Pull back all the people

224
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,200
watching Feng Suige's residence!

225
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,620
But if we pull them back now...

226
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,840
My father is in someone else's hands!

227
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,770
What's the point of keeping watch?

228
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,550
Go!

229
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,360
Yes.

230
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:37,870
Yes.

231
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,510
Fu Yixiao,

232
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,550
just you wait.

233
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,610
[Wutong Mansion]

234
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,600
Lu Ke.

235
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,440
Miss Yixiao?

236
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,000
Where have you been?

237
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,870
His Highness has long known

238
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,010
that you haven't left Yujing.

239
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,370
I'll explain later.

240
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,600
Where is your master?

241
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,910
He entered the palace last night

242
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,320
and hasn't returned today.

243
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,910
Then please pass on a message for me.

244
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,390
I want to see him at 3 p.m. today.

245
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,600
Tell him to come alone.

246
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,440
Is there anything else

247
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,640
you want me to convey?

248
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,680
Give this to him.

249
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,860
He knows where we should meet.

250
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,910
How does he...

251
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,110
Make sure to tell him.

252
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,240
I have something very important

253
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,910
to tell him.

254
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,210
Don't worry.

255
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,740
I have one more thing to tell you.

256
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,630
Appointing a crown prince
is a major matter.

257
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,050
His Majesty is wise and mighty.

258
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,370
He must have made arrangements already!

259
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,240
Do you really think,

260
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,260
while he's ill,

261
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,670
that you alone

262
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,550
can turn everything upside down?

263
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,360
Give up that idea!

264
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,220
Greetings, Prime Minister Zhuang.

265
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,840
May I ask why

266
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,980
you summoned me?

267
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,300
You don't know why?

268
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,260
It's just the two of us here.

269
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,190
Mr. Ma,

270
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,320
let's just

271
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,320
speak plainly.

272
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,010
You've been serving His Majesty
for so long.

273
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,130
You must be his most trusted person.

274
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,280
His Majesty always plans ahead.

275
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,390
Since he knows

276
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,630
he has a terminal illness,

277
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,240
he must have made preparations.

278
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,720
Has he already drafted

279
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,080
an edict of succession?

280
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,870
I am merely

281
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,790
the head eunuch.

282
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,360
Many things are beyond my knowledge.

283
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,200
Please understand, Prime Minister Zhuang.

284
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,840
You are his most trusted person.

285
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,280
If there is an edict,

286
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
it should be in your custody, right?

287
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,630
I truly know nothing.

288
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,650
I'm only asking.

289
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,670
Since you don't know,

290
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,870
I'll trust you.

291
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,600
I will fulfill my duty as Prime Minister

292
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,860
and summon all the key ministers at court

293
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,360
to discuss the matter
of appointing the crown prince.

294
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,960
Mr. Ma,

295
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
don't wait until we reach a decision

296
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,750
and then suddenly pull out

297
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,030
some imperial edict—

298
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,120
that would be

299
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,150
impossible to deal with.

300
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,390
Yao.

301
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,510
I heard about what happened
to the Elder Marquis.

302
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,910
How is the situation now?

303
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,200
You've heard that?

304
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,000
Someone actually dared to lay hands

305
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,589
on the Elder Marquis in Yujing City.

306
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,990
They're courting death.

307
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,270
I'll order all the elite soldiers

308
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,599
from the Feng Battalion

309
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,720
to search the entire city.

310
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,160
We'll leave no stone unturned

311
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,640
to find...

312
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,770
No need to trouble the Feng Battalion.

313
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,730
I have the Imperial Guards.

314
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,370
Yao,

315
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,160
The Elder Marquis is like a father to me.

316
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,880
Anyone who dares to kidnap him

317
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,310
is making an enemy of me.

318
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,030
Tell me

319
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,200
what happened

320
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,680
before the Elder Marquis disappeared.

321
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,140
I want to figure out
who might be behind this.

322
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,480
My father spent most of his life
on the battlefield.

323
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,880
He made too many enemies.

324
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,200
Countless people want to harm him.

325
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,150
Forget it.

326
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,460
Don't worry

327
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,350
about it.

328
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,810
I came to see you

329
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,880
because the duty of guarding the palace

330
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,880
has to be temporarily handed over to you.

331
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,160
You must keep watch over
the palace for me.

332
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,720
Alright.

333
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:16,830
What?

334
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,590
You don't trust me?

335
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,840
Of course I trust you.

336
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,920
You're my best friend.

337
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,030
You seem a bit off today.

338
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,510
What I'm going to do now

339
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,720
is catch the person

340
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,830
who harmed my father,

341
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,400
flay him, pull out his entrails,

342
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,530
grind him into mince

343
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,010
and feed it to the dogs.

344
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,880
I'm not like my father.

345
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,960
I'll collect any debts

346
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,210
owed to the Murong family.

347
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,310
Even if it's my closest friend,

348
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,270
I'll settle the score.

349
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,030
A dancing girl

350
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,210
got beaten to death for no reason.

351
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,000
I know

352
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,550
you wanted to teach the Prince of Zhennan
a lesson,

353
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,110
but you shouldn't have killed her
so recklessly.

354
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,040
If this gets out,

355
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,000
how will it look?

356
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,060
Also,

357
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,620
when I came in just now,

358
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,350
I saw another official's wife

359
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,400
leaving your place.

360
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,090
Tell me,

361
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,780
what's with her clothes?

362
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,590
Mother,
you think it looks good too, right?

363
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,310
I picked it for her.

364
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,920
Absurd!

365
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,840
That's the Princess of Zhennan's outfit.

366
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,440
Don't tell me you have feelings for her.

367
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,790
I didn't think it that way.

368
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,030
But now that you mentioned it…

369
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,510
Don't you dare set your sights on her!

370
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,550
There are plenty of consorts
in the palace,

371
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,680
but you never touch them.

372
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,160
Yet you always scheme after

373
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,220
officials' wives.

374
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,070
I'm tired of lecturing you

375
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,350
about your rotten behavior.

376
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,190
But remember,

377
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,270
you are not
to touch the Princess of Zhennan.

378
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,000
Mother,

379
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,310
you don't actually treat him

380
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,570
as your own son, do you?

381
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,680
If I had a son like him,

382
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,130
would I still be getting angry every day

383
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,880
like this?

384
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,590
You sent him back to the capital

385
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,920
without consulting me.

386
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,590
This is clearly

387
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,720
asking for trouble.

388
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,170
You humiliated him again last night?

389
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,070
He can't stay in the capital anymore.

390
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,600
Send him away immediately.

391
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,920
Send him away?

392
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,350
That's like releasing a tiger
back to the mountain.

393
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,240
Once he reaches Shengjing,

394
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,040
Pingling City will get the news.

395
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,920
Mother, are you really that afraid of him?

396
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,920
What I'm afraid of is political instability
in Jinxiu

397
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,240
and internal strife.

398
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,940
As you said,

399
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,000
his greatest support

400
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,600
is the army in Pingling City.

401
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,350
Now that he's in Shengjing,

402
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,310
he's in danger.

403
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,230
Mother,

404
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,000
how do you think he can communicate

405
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,530
with them in Pingling City?

406
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,720
If he's obedient, it'll be fine.

407
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,590
But if he's not,

408
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,750
he'll definitely make moves in Shengjing.

409
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,160
I want him to reveal

410
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,070
all his cards

411
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,750
in Shengjing.

412
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,020
Just one thing—

413
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,480
you must not set your sights
on the Princess of Susha.

414
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,590
Bai Shouzhuo!

415
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,680
Your Majesty.

416
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,790
The Empress Dowager forbids me

417
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,200
from setting my sights
on the Princess of Susha.

418
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,930
I had no such intention anyway.

419
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,200
But now,

420
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,610
somehow,

421
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,920
I find this very intriguing.

422
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,680
Grandfather.

423
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,970
I heard your mother is ill.

424
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,960
Mother is sleeping.

425
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,650
Last night she went to see Father,

426
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,830
stayed up all night,

427
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,960
and ran a high fever.

428
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,400
The imperial physicians have already come

429
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,000
to check on her this morning.

430
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,830
How are you?

431
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,610
I spent the whole night
copying the Heart Sutra

432
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,930
for Father and Mother,

433
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,540
hoping they'll recover soon.

434
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,610
Let me ask you again—

435
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,720
how are you?

436
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,040
I...

437
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,680
You're 20 now,

438
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
a grown man.

439
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,160
Are you ready?

440
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,240
Father was perfectly fine before.

441
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,830
I don't know why

442
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,270
he suddenly became like this.

443
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,730
I truly don't understand.

444
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,880
If Father truly doesn't make it,

445
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,350
then...

446
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,120
That's not what I'm asking.

447
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,070
I'm asking

448
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,160
if you're ready

449
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,000
to become the ruler of the realm.

450
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,520
Once your father passes away

451
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,480
and Feng Suige takes the throne,

452
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,920
he'll kill you

453
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,160
and all of us.

454
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,480
Our lives are in your hands.

455
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,240
Only you can protect us.

456
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,240
I've...

457
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,610
never thought about that.

458
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,200
Don't you even trust your grandfather?

459
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,200
I do.

460
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:23,960
I...

461
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,280
respect you the most.

462
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,510
Then why aren't you looking at me

463
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,720
when you speak?

464
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,310
Remember,

465
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,270
I always stand by your side.

466
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,450
You, your mother,

467
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,600
and I—

468
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,410
our fates

469
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,500
rise and fall together.

470
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,580
I'll do

471
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,160
whatever you say.

472
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,050
I want you

473
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,950
to become Emperor.

474
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,200
Yes.

475
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,890
To be Emperor, you must act like one.

476
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,070
Louder!

477
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,290
I want to be Emperor.

478
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,100
Your Highness,

479
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,290
Miss Yixiao asked me to give this to you.

480
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,490
What else did she say?

481
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,690
Nothing.

482
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,700
She said that once you see it,

483
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,830
you'll understand.

484
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,440
She was so cautious

485
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,510
about asking me to meet.

486
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,180
There must be a reason.

487
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,150
Did she look well?

488
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,110
She seemed fine.

489
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,350
No illness, no injuries,

490
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,390
nothing unusual—

491
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,870
just a bit mysterious.

492
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,600
Oh, right.

493
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,720
She repeatedly reminded me

494
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,350
to tell you that

495
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,750
you must go see her alone.

496
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,590
It's not safe to talk here.

497
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,300
Follow me.

00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,200

that the reason you cautiously

510
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,460
asked to see me

511
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,970
must be that something happened.

512
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,040
I've already caught Wu Ying.

513
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,000
I'll make her

514
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,960
feel the pain

515
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,920
you once suffered a thousandfold.

516
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,750
Aren't you happy

517
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,640
to hear that?

518
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,350
I am.

519
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,680
Really?

520
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,960
On your face,

521
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,160
I can't see

522
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,420
any sign of happiness.

523
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,640
Do you remember that day,

524
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,480
when I helped you save Yun Qing,

525
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,790
you promised me 5 favors?

526
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,440
Now there are 4 left.

527
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,680
Today,

528
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,510
I want to use another one.

529
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,720
No matter

530
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,750
what you hear,

531
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,500
you must promise me

532
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,110
to stay calm.

533
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,720
Alright.

534
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,480
I've discovered Meng Junran's
true identity.

535
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,210
He is Murong Yao.

536
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,820
What are you saying?

537
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,010
How could he possibly be...

538
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,700
You're not joking?

539
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,760
I know it's hard for you to accept.

540
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,470
Before coming to see you,

541
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,110
I considered all possibilities.

542
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,810
I know

543
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,620
Murong Yao is your best friend

544
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,370
and the person you trust most.

545
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,280
I considered
whether I should hide this from you.

546
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,200
I also thought about

547
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,460
who you'd choose to believe

548
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,480
between him and me.

549
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,580
I even thought

550
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,480
you might suspect

551
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,720
that I'm a spy from Jinxiu,

552
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,790
or that I've been sent

553
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,960
by Xia Jingshi

554
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,960
on some secret mission—

555
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,720
that I

556
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
came to you

557
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,310
only to help him drive a wedge

558
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,170
between you and your best friend.

559
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,640
Feng Suige,

560
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,040
I've thought through all of it.

561
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,450
Even if you doubt me,

562
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,640
even if my words hurt you,

563
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,270
even if

564
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,760
it means losing you,

565
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,650
I've still decided to tell you.

566
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,750
I don't want to

567
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,030
keep anything from you.

568
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,030
You have the right to know the truth.

569
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,070
Can you tell me again—

570
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,770
who is Meng Junran?

571
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,510
You said it's Yao?

572
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Murong Yao?

573
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,280
I know this must be painful for you.

574
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,030
If your chest feels tight

575
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,350
and it's hard to breathe,

576
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,880
just take a few deep breaths

577
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,570
and let it out.

578
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,180
It's okay.

579
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,560
Everything will be fine.

580
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,570
It will all get better.

581
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,920
I'm fine.

582
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,330
I'll go ask him face to face.

583
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,480
You promised me.

584
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,540
You must stay calm.

585
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,410
Don't worry.

586
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,280
I invited you all here today

587
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,070
to discuss

588
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,840
several important matters.

589
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,590
Minister Hou of the Ministry of War
was attacked and injured;

590
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,240
he has requested leave to recover
in his hometown.

591
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,550
The position of Minister

592
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,030
cannot remain vacant.

593
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,590
Let's have Vice Minister Liu Qin
of the Ministry of War

594
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,870
temporarily take over the duties
of the minister.

595
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,340
I will serve with utmost dedication

596
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,810
until my dying breath.

597
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,070
Second,

598
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,290
His Majesty's condition is now critical,

599
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,030
and the position of Crown Prince
remains vacant.

600
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,640
As

601
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,470
both a court official

602
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,000
and a member of the royal family,

603
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,590
I

604
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,830
shouldn't speak pessimistically,

605
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,650
but for the sake of the realm,

606
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,570
we can no longer delay

607
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,340
the matter of succession.

608
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,560
In my opinion,

609
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,440
the Second Prince,
being the Empress's legitimate son

610
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,590
of noble birth

611
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,790
and virtuous character,

612
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,030
is the most suitable choice

613
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,510
for Crown Prince.

614
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,960
But after all, the First Prince

615
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,310
is the eldest legitimate son.

616
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,440
Throughout history,
the tradition has always been

617
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,920
to appoint the eldest legitimate son
as Crown Prince.

618
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,880
Shouldn't the First Prince
be appointed the Crown Prince?

619
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,680
His Majesty is the founding emperor—

620
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,480
there's no fixed rule

621
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,100
for succession in Susha.

622
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,880
Although the First Prince
is the eldest legitimate son,

623
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,590
he has repeatedly defied His Majesty

624
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,640
and acted without restraint.

625
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,900
With such conduct,

626
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,640
how can we entrust Susha's future

627
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,240
to him?

628
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,940
I agree.

629
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,680
Before, during the Ancestral Ceremony,

630
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,720
His Majesty personally appointed

631
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,310
the Second Prince
as the secondary officiant.

632
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,400
Clearly, in His Majesty's eyes,

633
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,880
the Second Prince possesses
both virtue and talent.

634
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,540
Thus, he is the best candidate

635
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,300
for Crown Prince.

636
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,790
I agree.

637
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,480
I understand

638
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,720
what you are suggesting.

639
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,470
Please rest assured.

640
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,510
Appointing an heir
concerns the nation's fate,

641
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,200
and I

642
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,640
will handle it with the utmost care.

643
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,640
Prime Minister Zhuang,
the wise carry heavier burdens.

644
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,170
Thank you for your efforts.

645
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,460
Thank you for your efforts,
Prime Minister.

646
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,240
I heard from others

647
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,440
that you were badly wounded
in the Battle of Pingling.

648
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,110
I came here to

649
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,310
end our brotherhood.

650
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,680
I no longer consider you my brother.

651
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,150
You've been saying that

652
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,500
since we were children.

653
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,440
Don't tell me

654
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,830
you'll miss me.

655
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,110
Get lost!

656
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,240
With you in Yujing City,

657
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,720
I'm annoyed nonstop all day.

658
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,790
Annoyed?

659
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,160
Aren't you happy with me here?
Why are you annoyed?

660
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,000
But then again...

661
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,640
If I were the Commander
of the Imperial Guards,

662
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,570
I could certainly be of help to you.

663
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,730
Don't you do that for me.

664
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,880
I know you.

665
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,160
You hate being tied down the most.

666
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,940
But you have no influence

667
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,050
in the court.

668
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,110
Now that His Majesty has even had
the Second Prince

669
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,030
take your place at the Ancestral Ceremony,

670
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,310
how could I leave you behind

671
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,710
and enjoy freedom alone?

672
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,010
[Murong Residence]

673
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,190
[Murong Residence]

674
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,670
I've been waiting for you.

675
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,580
I knew it.

676
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,600
Fu Yixiao told you everything.

677
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,360
Looks like she really does

678
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,650
mean more to you than I do.

679
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,440
We've been brothers for so many years.

680
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,300
You believe everything she says?

681
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,420
I came here

682
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,900
to hear it from you directly—

683
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,110
are you Meng Junran?

684
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,360
Yes.

685
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,490
Did Zhuang Shen force you?

686
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,520
What leverage does he have on you?

687
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,650
If you weren't being coerced,

688
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,090
if you had no weakness,

689
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,220
you'd never do this.

690
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,920
Yao,

691
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,150
we've been brothers for so many years.

692
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,580
What can't you tell me?

693
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,990
Are you in trouble?

694
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:16,730
Tell me.

695
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,860
I did it willingly!

696
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,340
No one forced me!

697
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,380
Why?

698
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,760
I can't stand seeing you do so well.

699
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,020
I'm jealous of you.

700
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,090
You still won't tell me the truth?

701
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,000
See?

702
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,870
You don't believe me anyway.

703
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,510
Fine.

704
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,650
Then tell me—

705
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,670
what have I

706
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,930
ever done to wrong you?

707
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,150
Why must it be that

708
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,320
only if you wronged me

709
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,870
could I stand against you?

710
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,920
Am I not worthy to be your rival?

711
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,800
If I want to go against you,

712
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,110
it doesn't have to be
for some hidden reason.

713
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,770
It can simply be my own choice.

714
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,510
Your own choice?

715
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,530
All my life,

716
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,260
I've seen you as my closest brother.

717
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,590
And now you're telling me

718
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,550
you're going against me

719
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,070
of your own choice?

720
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,960
So you colluded with Xia Jingshi

721
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,990
and Zhuang Shen

722
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,190
to take my life?

723
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,850
I could have spared your life.

724
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,320
I could have done everything

725
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,360
I wanted

726
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,820
without you ever knowing.

727
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,590
But you got in my way.

728
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,560
I have no choice.

729
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,500
There's nothing else I can do.

730
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,880
What are you trying to do?

731
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,280
Tell me!

732
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,380
Murong Yao,

733
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,630
what do you want?

734
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,740
When we were 10,

735
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,190
we went with our fathers
to inspect the border.

736
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:46,960
Do you remember

737
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,150
that time we sneaked off

738
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,110
without permission to play

739
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,440
and ran into assassins?

740
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,220
Don't come any closer!

741
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,670
What are you doing?

742
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,480
Stay back!

743
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,590
If my father hadn't arrived in time,

744
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,090
we would have been doomed.

745
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,760
But there were too many assassins.

746
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
My father couldn't handle them all.

747
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,350
I only realized later

748
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,840
that my father at that moment

749
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,550
never thought

750
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,710
he would survive.

751
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,030
The only person

752
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,110
he cared about

753
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,400
was you,

754
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,840
the First Prince.

755
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,190
Kill!

756
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,480
In that life-and-death moment,

757
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,710
the first person he tried to save

758
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,310
was you, not me.

759
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,860
Father!

760
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,560
I was his own son!

761
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,320
Go!

762
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,440
At the time, I couldn't understand

763
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,190
why your life

764
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,790
was more precious than mine.

765
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,350
Later, I realized

766
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,710
it was because you were the First Prince.

767
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,480
If anything had happened to you,

768
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,340
the entire Murong family
would have been executed.

769
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,440
That's why my father

770
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,170
risked everything to save you.

771
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,030
Father!

772
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,280
Father!

773
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,960
Yao!

774
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,230
Yao!

775
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,450
Yao!

776
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,150
That was the first time

777
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,550
I ever truly faced death.

778
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,550
I remember countless blades

779
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,410
slashing toward my father and me.

780
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,660
My mind went blank,

781
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,050
and all I could do was cry

782
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,020
and beg for someone to save me.

783
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,980
It hurt so much.

784
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,590
The pain was unbearable.

785
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,760
I passed out from the pain.

786
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,360
When I woke up,

787
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,960
they were all dead.

788
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,300
My father was severely wounded,

789
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,440
all from blades.

790
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,150
It was then that his leg was injured

791
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,320
and left with a chronic ailment.

792
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,850
Even now,
it still pains him from time to time.

793
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,670
Father!

794
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,010
Son.

795
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,480
Father!

796
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,590
With me here,

797
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,230
you don't need to be afraid of anything.

798
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,480
Suige!

799
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,360
Suige, please come save us!

800
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,720
What happened next?

801
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,400
How did you get out of danger?

802
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,800
I kept waiting,

803
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
waiting for His Majesty to send people
to rescue us.

804
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,590
But I waited for a long time,

805
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,030
and no one ever came.

806
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,280
Later I realized,

807
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,630
as long as you,
the First Prince, was safe,

808
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,960
no one would care
whether we lived or died.

809
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,000
The First Prince was ambushed,
and His Majesty flew into a rage.

810
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,840
At that time,

811
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,030
who would have remembered

812
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,000
my father and me?

813
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,360
That road

814
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,140
was only a few miles from the border camp,

815
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,150
yet it was the longest, hardest road

816
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,120
I've ever walked in my life.

817
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,510
Here's His Majesty's verbal decree!

818
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,370
Murong Zhong, heed this command.

819
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,500
From this day on,

820
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,710
the Murong clan

821
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,550
is to guard the northern border of Susha.

822
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,880
You are forbidden to return to the capital

823
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,210
without royal summons.

824
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,140
I

825
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,240
will depart tomorrow.

826
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,820
Better if you leave today.

827
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,430
His Majesty also said

828
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,920
that the Murong family
bears unshirkable responsibility

829
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,000
for what happened

830
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,940
to the First Prince.

831
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,690
But

832
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,510
in recognition of your service
in protecting him,

833
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,190
you will not be punished.

834
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,630
Thank you, Your Majesty.

835
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,930
Yao,

836
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,840
my father and I

837
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,880
gave you the chance to live,

838
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,710
yet in the end, we were sent to suffer

839
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,590
in the northern frontier.

840
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,670
Why is your life

841
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,030
worth more than ours?

842
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,590
Why must the Murong family

843
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,230
always be ready

844
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,090
to sacrifice for the Feng family?

845
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,520
Why didn't you send people to get us

846
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,800
after you returned?

847
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,630
Why didn't you send people to save us?

848
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,960
Why didn't you
plead with His Majesty for us?

849
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,320
Aren't we brothers?

850
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,200
Where were you when I needed you?

851
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,150
Where were you?

852
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,360
After I woke up,

853
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,320
the first thing I did was ask

854
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,920
how you and your father were.

855
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,980
But they told me at the time

856
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,980
that you were already out of danger.

857
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,280
When I saw you again,

858
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,630
it was two years later.

859
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,430
So at that time I thought

860
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,030
you...

861
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,070
You thought?

862
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,190
You Fengs

863
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,670
always only care about what you think.

864
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,000
Have you ever considered how others feel?

865
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,880
Yao,

866
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,360
why didn't you

867
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,120
tell me all this sooner?

868
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,630
If I had told you earlier,

869
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,000
could you have given me back
part of my foot?

870
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,630
Could you have made my father's legs

871
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,490
stop hurting so much every night?

872
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,500
Even if I had told you earlier,

873
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,030
what could I have gained—

874
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,100
besides your pity?

875
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,220
Feng Suige,

876
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,220
let me tell you—

877
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,110
the thing I despise most

878
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,000
in this life

879
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,360
is your pity.

880
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,930
I also come from a military family!

881
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,070
I want to be a great general

882
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,520
like you.

883
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,110
But I can't even ride a horse.

884
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,920
Back then, my father and yours

885
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,440
fought side by side
to build Susha together.

886
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,360
Your father became emperor,

887
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,190
while mine is just a marquis

888
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,760
in name only.

889
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,550
Is that fair?

890
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,480
Yao,

891
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,050
stop this.

892
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,900
While you still can.

893
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,190
I've been thinking about this
for over a decade.

894
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,270
How do you expect me to stop?

895
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,100
How can I?

896
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,320
For once, I want to live for myself.

897
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,920
I only want the Murong family

898
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,590
to get what it rightfully deserves.

899
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,500
Is that wrong?

900
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,840
While my father is in Fu Yixiao's hands,

901
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,300
I can't do anything to you.

902
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,660
You can kill me.

903
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,600
What?

904
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,810
Can't bring yourself to do it?

905
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,950
How about now?

906
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,040
Can you bring yourself to do it now?

907
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,010
I have only one condition:

908
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,170
release my father.

909
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,040
He knows nothing about this.

910
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,360
From today on,

911
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,480
we're even.

912
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,480
We're no longer brothers.
