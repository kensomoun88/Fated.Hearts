[Episode 16]

3
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,039
Although your hand injury
can heal completely,

4
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,560
it won't get better

5
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,759
in just a day or two.

6
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,000
As for lifting heavy things,

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,229
let others do it for you.

8
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,840
And archery is absolutely forbidden.

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,900
Do you understand?

10
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,720
I understand.

11
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,790
It's all my father's fault.

12
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,280
If he had come to Yujing earlier,

13
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,840
your hand injury

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,970
wouldn't have been delayed until now.

15
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,139
Lord Ling helped me save Ning Fei

16
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,539
and treated my injury.

17
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,360
I am so thankful

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,710
for such great kindness.

19
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,910
How could I blame him?

20
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,310
By the way,

21
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,920
is there any news about Ning Fei?

22
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,079
I asked my father.

23
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,590
He told me not to inquire.

24
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,800
He said the person has been delivered

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,660
and will naturally receive help.

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,560
Sister.

27
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,820
Don't worry.

28
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,750
As soon as there's any news,

29
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,280
I'll tell you immediately.

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,560
By the way,

31
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,829
when are you leaving?

32
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,160
Leaving?

33
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,430
Heading where?

34
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,480
Leaving Susha.

35
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,520
Since you already know

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,829
Xia Jingshi was the one
who wanted to harm you

37
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,430
and have completely

38
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,630
severed ties with him,

39
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,290
why stay in Yujing any longer?

40
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,470
My father is urging me
to return to Zhengnian Villa.

41
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,950
Why don't you come with me?

42
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,560
I've asked Shunzi and the others.

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,430
As long as you agree,

44
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,090
they're willing

45
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,590
to return to Zhengnian Villa with me.

46
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,390
Since we've become sworn sisters,

47
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,360
and are now family,

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,300
you'll be just like me.

49
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,910
We'll both be Young Young Mistresses.

50
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,800
If that doesn't work,

51
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,280
I can ask my father
to adopt you as his goddaughter.

52
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,140
That way you'll have a family too.

53
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,430
Thank you.

54
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,960
So you agree?

55
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,680
But I promised Feng Suige

56
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,800
to help him

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,260
find the traitor in Susha.

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,360
That's Feng Suige's business.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,870
You've helped him enough already.

60
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,120
I’m still shaken by

61
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,750
the previous assassination attempt on you.

62
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,840
Aren't you afraid

63
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,579
to continue staying here?

64
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,440
Don't worry,

65
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,100
I can protect myself.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,860
You haven't fallen for him, have you?

67
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,010
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,630
I just feel that

69
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,810
your attitude toward Feng Suige

70
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,270
is different than before.

71
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,430
You said you were just using each other,

72
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,760
but now you're practically inseparable.

73
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,380
We just have important matters to discuss.

74
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,680
You discuss things during the day,

75
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,000
you discuss things over the night.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,530
Are there really
that many things to discuss?

77
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,350
Miss Yixiao,

78
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,920
someone is here for you.

79
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
His Highness sent me to fetch you.

80
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,980
He says he has important matters
to discuss.

81
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,430
Sister.

[Lotus Pavilion]

83
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,000
Long time no see.

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,460
-Come in.
-Please come in.

85
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,620
Young Master, come in and have a seat.

86
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,650
Come again, young Master.

87
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,380
Your Highness.

[Lotus Pavilion]

89
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,950
Young Master, come in and take a look.

90
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,810
Why are we here?

91
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,390
The person who delivered silver to Xia Jingshi

92
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,230
through the Rongtong Escort Agency

93
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,070
is most likely a dancer here

94
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,560
named Ruyan.

95
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,830
What's wrong?

96
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,650
You go in first. I'll be right back.

97
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,570
Young Master, come in and have a seat.

98
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,340
Come, please step inside.

99
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,460
Are you alone, Young Master?

100
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,550
Could you please ask

101
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,470
for Miss Ruyan for me?

102
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,240
Ruyan already has an appointment today.

103
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,270
Why not let me

104
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,490
keep you company for a few drinks?

105
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,480
May I ask who

106
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,430
has an appointment with Miss Ruyan?

107
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,630
Young Master Murong.

108
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,000
Miss Linglan.

109
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,670
Sui...

110
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,470
Suige?

111
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,680
What are you doing here?

112
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,240
I thought you

113
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,970
don't come to places like this.

114
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,290
What's going on?

115
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,470
Why did you come here?

116
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,270
Didn't I ask you to watch the villa?

117
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,159
Don't worry, I've arranged everything.

118
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,750
Even the servants,

119
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,920
I've replaced them with my own people.

120
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,750
If anything happens,

121
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,550
I'll know about it immediately.

122
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,630
You... I really...

123
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,190
I'm not interfering with your business.

124
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,050
Think about it,

125
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,190
I can't just stand guard

126
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,360
at the villa entrance every day, can I?

127
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,830
Then wouldn't I have just

128
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,690
become nothing but a doorkeeper?

129
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,790
Don't worry.

130
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,330
Miss Linglan.

131
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,340
Haven’t seen you in a few days
and you’ve gotten prettier!

132
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,080
Thank you.

133
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Where is your sister?

134
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,040
She is waiting for you upstairs.

135
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,950
No wonder they say you're lucky.

136
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,070
It took me half a month of waiting

137
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,560
before I finally

138
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,680
secured a meeting with Miss Ruyan.

139
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,340
You're much luckier than I am.

140
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,520
I'm going now.

141
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,600
Let's go. Since you're already here.

142
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,920
Let me tell you, her dancing is really...

143
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,840
Miss Ruyan.

144
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,510
This is

145
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,120
my best friend since childhood.

146
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,850
He's a rare and honoured guest.

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,860
Make sure he's well taken care of.

148
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,040
Young Master, you look distinguished.

149
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,640
Surely a man of great talent.

150
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,820
Please enjoy yourselves, gentlemen.

151
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,090
I'll go change into my attire.

152
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,040
Go ahead.

153
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,360
That won't be necessary.

154
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,270
I didn't come here today

155
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,800
to enjoy music and dancing.

156
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,830
No need to change your clothes.

157
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,300
Then what brings you here?

158
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,090
I have something to ask you.

159
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,330
Come.

160
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
No need to be formal.

161
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,090
Sit down.

162
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,810
Sit down. It's fine.

163
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,510
Sit.

164
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,090
Listen to what my friend

165
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:22,820
has to ask you

166
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,430
and just answer truthfully.

167
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:24,950
Yes.

168
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,870
What?

169
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,450
You need to leave first.

170
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,690
Me? Leave?

171
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,780
Why should I leave?

172
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,430
Don't ask about things

173
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,290
you shouldn't.

174
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,240
What secrets

175
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,280
could you two be hiding?

176
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,600
Didn't you just tell me

177
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,600
that you've never met her before?

178
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,560
Isn't this your first time here?

179
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,140
You lied to me, did you?

180
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,000
Get out.

181
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,120
I'm the one who made the appointment
with Miss Ruyan.

182
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,480
You're just riding on my coattails.

183
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Do you know how many rich young men

184
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,909
in the capital are waiting in line?

185
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,409
I paid a lot.

186
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,480
Are you sure you're just asking questions?

187
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,940
What else would I be doing?

188
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,790
Then hurry up.

189
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,490
Wait for me.

190
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,560
No need to be nervous.

191
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,400
I just have some questions.

192
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:15,920
Alright.

193
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,380
Two bowls of noodles.

194
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,090
Miss Xiaoxue, you're here early today.

195
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,620
Please make it quick today.

196
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,730
Sure thing.

197
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,230
Coming right up.

198
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,890
Here you go.

199
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,850
[Stand by outside Yujing City]

200
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,840
Rongtong Escort Agency?

201
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,000
Young Master, you come to my dance house

202
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,260
not to enjoy the dance

203
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,240
but to ask about the escort agency?

204
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Did you have Rongtong Escort Agency

205
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,550
deliver something to Pingling City
in Jinxiu?

206
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,360
Yes, I did.

207
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,060
What was delivered

208
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,000
and to whom?

209
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,030
That I don't know.

210
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,390
Young Master, please don't glare at me.

211
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,840
You're scaring me.

212
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,140
Please tell me the truth, Miss Ruyan.

213
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,920
I was entrusted by a patron

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
to arrange a delivery
with the escort agency.

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,790
But in our line of work,

216
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,200
we avoid asking questions.

217
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,530
So what was delivered and to whom,

218
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,110
I didn't ask at all.

219
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,600
Then this patron,

220
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,630
who is he?

221
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,100
Young Master.

222
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,870
If I reveal his name,

223
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,030
I won't be able to survive
in Yujing City anymore.

224
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,440
Please stop asking, Young Master.

225
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,510
I won't tell you.

226
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,600
Miss Ruyan, I'm afraid you don't know that

227
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,730
if you don't tell me,

228
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,000
the consequences will be

229
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,670
a thousand times worse.

230
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,840
The last time

231
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,170
I broke someone's neck,

232
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
I didn't apply the right technique.

233
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,320
So it caused that person

234
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,930
to take an hour to die.

235
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,980
The pain was unbearable.

236
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,960
Who are you really, Young Master?

237
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
You folks are well-informed here.

238
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,840
Surely you've heard about

239
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,100
who had their neck broken in Yujing City?

240
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,510
You are...

241
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,850
The First Prince?

242
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,670
Miss Ruyan, I ask that

243
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,120
you tell me the truth.

244
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,820
The person who hired me that day

245
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,840
was Manager Luo from Changsheng Bank.

246
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,640
He was too drunk to walk that day,

247
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,030
and was afraid
of delaying important business,

248
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,270
so he asked me to visit the escort agency.

249
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,960
He even gave me some silver as payment.

250
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,600
As for what the goods were,

251
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,830
I have no idea.

252
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,240
I swear to heaven.

253
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,910
I was just running errands

254
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,150
and delivering messages for him.

255
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,720
If there was anything wrong
with the goods,

256
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,920
it has absolutely nothing to do with me.

257
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,630
I swear to heaven.

258
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,390
There's not a single lie
in what I've said,

259
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,120
or else,

260
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,570
may I die of festering sores

261
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,100
and never be reincarnated.

262
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,670
Good.

263
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,810
Nice performance.

264
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,890
Let's go.

265
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,270
What is your reason

266
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,120
for looking for Miss Ruyan?

267
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,470
What is it that I can't know about?

268
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,900
It's none of your business.

269
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,670
That won't do.

270
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,630
If it concerns Miss Ruyan,

271
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,760
then it concerns me.

272
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,150
I just wanted to ask Miss Ruyan

273
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,110
some questions.

274
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,320
It really has nothing to do with you.

275
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,630
Where are you going?

276
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,980
You don't know how to treat a lady.

277
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,380
You must have scared her.

278
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,120
-I need to comfort her.
-His Majesty entrusted

279
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,150
the Imperial Guards to you.

280
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,570
Such an important responsibility
given to you,

281
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,120
and here you are

282
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,400
chasing after women.

283
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,970
And in broad daylight too.

284
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,790
As if you're afraid people don't know

285
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,730
who you are.

286
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,390
Yes.

287
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,880
Then I'll come back after dark.

288
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,190
I really want to kick you to death.

289
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,410
You're bluffing. You wouldn't bear to.

290
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,670
Just let me say a word to her.

291
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,670
Comfort her a bit.

292
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,100
Go, go, go.

293
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,150
The Junior Marquis hasn't changed a bit

294
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,320
over all these years.

295
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,840
Just playing around for fun.

296
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,750
Nobody can control him.

297
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,550
Go and bring Manager Luo

298
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,190
from Changsheng Bank

299
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,720
to meet me immediately.

300
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,360
Wait.

301
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,180
Where's Yixiao?

302
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,310
Why hasn't she returned yet?

303
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,440
She said to let you go in first.

304
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,550
It shouldn't take too long.

305
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,430
It's been an incense stick's time already.

306
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,030
Why hasn't she come back yet?

307
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,140
Don't worry about me.

308
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,000
Go find Manager Luo immediately.

309
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,670
Hurry up.

310
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,190
Following me all the way here.

311
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,320
Didn't you consider

312
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,180
that I deliberately led you here?

313
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,550
It seems all the skills I taught you

314
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,410
have been completely forgotten.

315
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,240
Fu Yixiao.

316
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,840
All of you

317
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,790
carry deep blood feuds.

318
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,400
You have no family, no ties.

319
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,150
Your lives

320
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,020
are as cheap as ants.

321
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,120
If you wish to survive here,

322
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,000
you must become

323
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
the bravest death warriors.

324
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,320
You...

325
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,920
You're still alive.

326
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,200
What?

327
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,390
Hoping I was dead?

328
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,550
I treated you well back then.

329
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,880
How would the hideout of the death camp

330
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,200
not have any traps,

331
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,260
allowing strangers to enter freely?

332
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,880
You were too careless.

333
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,000
Muscle-weakening incense.

334
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,050
It won't kill you.

335
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,480
It only makes your entire body

336
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,830
weak and powerless.

337
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,920
Be good.

338
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,480
Don't resist.

339
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,640
Why are you still alive?

340
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,750
Naturally because of His Highness.

341
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,110
It was His Highness who gave me

342
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,370
the chance to survive.

343
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,280
His Highness...

344
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,630
As for you.

345
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,190
If His Highness hadn't saved you
back then,

346
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,680
how could you have survived until today?

347
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,200
Not only are you ungrateful,

348
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,130
you're even thinking of betrayal.

349
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,640
How is that possible?

350
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,600
How could it be His Highness?

351
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,980
He clearly told me

352
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,150
that the death camp

353
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,890
had been completely eliminated.

354
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,470
The death camp belongs to His Highness.

355
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,880
Why would anyone

356
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,200
eliminate their own power base?

357
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,550
If His Highness hadn't said

358
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,920
the death camp was completely eliminated,

359
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,000
how could you have spent all these years

360
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,510
being so devoted to him?

361
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,640
If I could expose myself,

362
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,910
I would have killed you

363
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,110
on the day you entered Yujing.

364
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,240
I wouldn't need those undercover guards

365
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,970
from His Highness' Residence.

366
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,350
Yixiao.

367
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,440
Yixiao.

368
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,630
If you want to kill me, then do it.

369
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,510
Go ahead.

370
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I can't kill you.

371
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,920
If I kill you,

372
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,030
His Highness would surely blame me.

373
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,380
But His Highness won't expect

374
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,560
that you come here today.

375
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,790
So...

376
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,390
Rest assured.

377
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,960
I'll make you die silently,

378
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,350

00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,260

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,270
where these people are.

566
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:19,920
Yes.

567
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,590
Do you want me

568
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,720
to apologize to you?

569
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:41,880
No.

570
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,440
You sent someone to summon me
to the palace.

571
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,110
I came,

572
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,550
but you're not saying anything.

573
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,920
Don't act like
you've done something wrong.

574
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,580
You didn't do anything wrong.

575
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,560
It was I who made the mistake.

576
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,750
I should have told you

577
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,550
about my plan to detain Xia Jingshi

578
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,200
in Susha beforehand.

579
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,480
After all,

580
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,770
he is your future husband.

581
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,400
This matter

582
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,070
is my fault.

583
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,790
Brother, you don't need to say that.

584
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,750
I'm not trying to please you deliberately.

585
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,840
I'm speaking from my heart.

586
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,350
I was wrong that day.

587
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,680
I shouldn't have said those things to you.

588
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,720
No matter what you say,

589
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,970
you are still my royal sister.

590
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,720
How could I blame you?

591
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,570
You've grown up now.

592
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,750
You're no longer that little girl

593
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,550
who needed her brother

594
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,150
to protect her at every turn.

595
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,400
You have your own thoughts

596
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,730
and your own decisions.

597
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,560
I can understand all of that.

598
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,160
I shouldn't have made you

599
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,190
live according to my wishes.

600
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,420
That's not fair to you.

601
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,550
But as your brother,

602
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,030
anticipating problems and keeping you
from danger is my duty.

603
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,360
This is what I should do.

604
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,570
Whether you listen or not,

605
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,830
I've said all I can say.

606
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,510
Brother.

607
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,650
Don't worry.

608
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,120
No matter who you marry,

609
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,960
as long as it's someone you love

610
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,290
and you won't regret it,

611
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,750
I will support you.

612
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,000
Because

613
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,160
more than anyone else in this world,

614
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,440
I want you to be happy.

615
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,880
Only if you live well

616
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,810
can I fulfill my promise to Mother.

617
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,070
Alright.

618
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,480
Don't worry.

619
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,270
And don't let me

620
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,400
ruin your mood.

621
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,370
It's your wedding day.

622
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,310
You should be happy.

623
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,640
Will you

624
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,050
come on my wedding day?

625
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,720
Of course.

626
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,460
I will certainly watch you get married
with my own eyes.
